# Windows Virtual Desktop

Contoso Healthcare, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, is a national healthcare provider with hospitals and doctors offices located throughout North America. The nature of their business requires a high level of security of personal health information (PHI) of patients, and personal identifiable information (PII) for their employees.

The business of healthcare has become more relient on mobile devices to access patient health records, which has created a concern over theft and data exposure.  Contoso would like to eliminate the possibility of any PHI or PII being located on a local device through use of a virtual desktop infrastructure.

Being a healthcare provider, Contoso has a requirement for applications to be accessible 24x7x365, so any infrastructure should be designed with high availability and scalability in mind.

Contoso currently has approximately 500 workstations within their environment with a number of healthcare practice applications, insurance applications, and business applications.  Contoso is currently supporting an existing data center with VMware for the server control plane and a partial deployment of Citrix virtual desktop infrastructure.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will gain experience designing solutions for Windows Virtual Desktop utilizing Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies.

The following components will need to be determined as part of the solutions. The first will consist of Microsoft 365 subscription that will be required to deliver the security requirements, Azure Active Directory, applications, and Windows licensing to users. Next, the Azure infrastructure that is required to support the Windows Virtual Desktop environment will need to be configured. Finally, the networking requirements will need to be determined for connectivity to the current on-premises infrastructure for application servers, and proper access to the user desktops and on-premises network with high security and limited latency.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to leverage various Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies together to build a secure, complex and robust Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure.

### Whiteboard design session

In the Whiteboard Design Session (WDS), you will work in groups to design a Windows Virtual Desktop solution using Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies. Your solution will consider the necessary Microsoft 365 subscription required for Windows 10 multi-user licensing, as well as the Azure Active Directory and security needs for a healthcare provider.  You will need to determine how to connect Azure to the current VMware and Citrix on-premises infrastructure and the connections needed to connect this infrastructure to Azure for application access. Finally, you will need to design the Windows Virtual Desktop solution utilizing Azure virtual machines with availability and scalability to handle 24x7x365 operations without performance degradation.

At the end of the whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a solution that leverages Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies together to build a secure and robust Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure.

### Hands-on lab

In the hands-on lab, you will implement a Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure that meet the requirements of the organization.  This will include assigning the appropriate Microsoft 365 subscription needed for Windows 10 multi-user licensing.  The proper Azure Active Directory role needed to create and configure the resources within the Microsoft 365 and Azure subscriptions will need to be assigned.  You will need to create the network infrastructure to connect the Azure network to the on-premises network, and allow users to access the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure within Azure.  The Azure virtual machine infrastrucure will need to be deployed to the Windows Virtual Desktop architecture standards.  Finally, you will create a standard image for the Windows Virtual Desktop.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to build a secure and robust Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure.
