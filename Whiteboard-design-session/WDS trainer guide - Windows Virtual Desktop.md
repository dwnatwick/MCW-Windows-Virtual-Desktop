# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Business continuity and disaster recovery whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to design a solution using Azure business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) technologies. Your solution will consider three different types of environments. The first will consist of on-premises VMs running applications that will be migrated to Azure IaaS. Next, Azure IaaS applications that need to be failed over from either on-premises to Azure, or between two Azure Regions. Finally, the use of automated failover technologies built into Azure PaaS services, App Service, and SQL Database will be used for PaaS applications.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a solution that leverages various Azure technologies together to build a complex and robust IaaS BCDR plan.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer.

2. Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Healthcare, headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, is a national healthcare provider with a network of affiliate hospitals and doctorâs offices located throughout North America. These locations continue to grow through acquisitions. The nature of their business requires a high level of security of personal health information (PHI) of patients, and personal identifiable information (PII) for their employees.

Contoso currently has approximately 500 workstations within their environment with a number of healthcare practice applications, insurance applications, and business applications. Contoso is currently supporting existing data centers in Detroit, MI and Dallas, Texas with VMware for the server control plane and a partial deployment of Citrix virtual desktop infrastructure.  These locations are connected with a private WAN connection and a backup VPN over broadband.  

Ken Greenwald, Contoso Healthcare CTO, has been evaluating the value of the public cloud and views Microsoft Azure as an excellent option to maintain availability and increase scalability of resources to the organization.  His team has also struggled with managing 500 workstations spread across the organization and needs an option to easily manage and maintain a standardized desktop image that gives users secure access to applications.  Ideally, these desktop images would not be maintained on local machines.  As Ken states, "Contoso Healthcare has continued to grow through the acquisition of doctor's offices and hospitals throughout North America, which has created an issue with our ability to standardize hardware at these locations.  The Board of Directors has been unwilling to increase capital expeditures for new equipment and we are forced as an IT organization to maximize our current infrastructure to deliver applications to users.  We need the ability to utilize what we have in place within our data centers and integrate Microsoft Azure technologies to facilite our ability to stardardize across the organization and quickly integrate a new office acquisition."

Contoso Healthcare's CISO, Laura Knight, has an additional list of objectives to address.  She is concerned with the threat of data exposure throughout the organization that is posed by the mulitple devices that they have acquired through their office acquisitions.  The continued increase in mobility of these devices raises concerns of PHI and PII being exposed to unauthorized individuals.  She also is responsible for the auditing of ISO/IEC 27001 and HIPAA controls.  Laura has said, "The growth of Contoso Healthcare has created an increased burden on my security and compliance organization.  It has become more difficult to monitor systems as they come online with variations of operating systems.  Some of these operating systems do not support mobile device management software to audit use and application access.  In addition, enforcing a centralized standard for security policies and access to confidential information has been challenging.  My organization needs to be able to maintain the security of our data and resources, and mitigate the prospect of data loss due to threat or unauthorized access to devices." 

Contoso Healthcare has completed an initial cloud assessment of their current infrastructure and applications, and they have divided the following areas that they feel that Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies can support:

**Security:** The business of healthcare has become more reliant on mobile devices to access patient health records, which has created a concern over theft and data exposure. Contoso would like to eliminate the possibility of any PHI or PII being located on a local device through use of a virtual desktop infrastructure. Security controls will need to audited, logged, and reviewed to ISO 27001 and HIPAA standards.

**Availability and Scalability:** Being a healthcare provider, Contoso has a requirement for applications to be accessible 24x7x365, so any infrastructure should be designed with high availability and scalability in mind. As Contoso Healthcare grows through acquisitions, they need to be able to scale out resources quickly for the addition of new users.

**Deployment Acceleration:** Contoso does not have a budget for additional capital expense required to upgrade current devices.  Therefore, they will need to utilize the current devices that are available to deliver a standard desktop image to users.   Contoso will be utilizing their current VMware and Citrix infrastructure for application delivery to user desktops.

### Customer needs

1. CH needs the ability to manage mobile device location and avoid access to patient health records when not on the Contoso Health network.

2. CH requires that any PHI and PII data is stored in a central encrypted storage account and not on local devices.

3. CH must be able to log activity and access, and be able to audit compliance to ISO 27001 and HIPAA controls.

4. CH requires 24x7x365 access to applications and the ability to scale resources as demand increases.

5. CH needs redundancy in network connections with low latency when accessing applications.

6. CH requires the ability to create and deploy a standardized desktop image to all users without the need to update and manage local devices.

7. CH needs to leverage the current application infrastructure in their current Detroit and Dallas datacenters.

### Customer objections

1. Contoso has made a substantial capital investment in their current data centers that they do not want to decommission. How can the infrastructure be architected to support the current data centers?

2. The CTO at Contoso does not want to invest in new workstations and mobile devices to support the standardized desktop image. Can these devices support the new image?

3. The CISO at Contoso needs to be convinced that data will not be exposed. How would Microsoft handle data protection?

4. Contoso must be able to log and audit all activity on the desktop image.  How will this be handled within the cloud and on-premises environments?

5. Connections between the cloud and existing data centers must be secure and reliable to support their requirements.  How will this be addressed and monitored?

## Preferred target audience

- Ken Greenwood, Contoso Healthcare CTO

- Laura Knight, Contoso Healthcare CISO

- Desktop Administrators

- Service Delivery Managers

- Infrastructure, Virtualization, Storage, and Networking Teams

## Preferred solution

*Provide an overview of the technologies and the implementation at a high-level. How will you use Microsoft 365 and Azure technologies to meet the Customer's needs?*

1. Microsoft 365

    - What Microsoft 365 subscription is required for Windows 10 multi-user licensing?
        - Microsoft 365 licenses that support Windows Virtual Desktop include M365 E3, E5, A3, A5, F3, and Business Premium.

    - What subscription is required for Contoso's mobile device requirements?
        - Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 or E5 are required for Intune MDM

    - What subscription is needed to classify and protect PHI and PII access?
        - Microsoft 365 E5 license is required for the full suite of data protection, information protection and classification, and advanced threat protection capabilities.

    - What subscription is necessary to enforce device access on the local network only?
        - Conditional access policies are available on EMS E3 and E5.  However, risk-based conditional access policies are only available on EMS E5, which would be best suited for this organization.

    - Why did you select the Microsoft 365 subscription(s)?

    Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 will be required with Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 to support the full list of requirements outlined by the customer.  Microsoft 365 licenses that support Windows Virtual Desktop include M365 E3, E5, A3, A5, F3, and Business Premium.  However, the additional requirements for mobile device management, data classification and information protection, and conditional access policies require the E5 and EMS E5 licenses.  Business Premium licensing is also only supported to up to 300 users.

2. Security

    - What is required to audit, log, and monitor controls for ISO 27001 and HIPAA? 
        - Azure Policy initiatives for ISO 27001 and HIPAA should be enabled for the Resource Groups that are created to govern the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure.  In addition, Azure Security Center should be upgraded to the Standard tier subscription to properly monitor and alert on control compliance to ISO 27001 and HIPAA standards.

    - How will you address monitoring these controls in Azure and the on-premises data centers?
        - Azure Monitor agents should be installed on all Azure and on-premises virtual machiness in order to govern the Azure Policy initiatives.  These agents will provide activity logs that can be monitored within Azure Security Center.

    - How will you avoid data exposure for data in-transit and data at-rest?
        - All connections for data in-transit will be transmitted through an encrypted SSL connection.  Data at-rest will be encryted at-rest. 

    - How will you maintain identity access management for the cloud and current Active Directory infrastructure, and how will they synchronize?
        - The cloud identity will be created within Azure Active Directory.  This will be the primary identity source for Microsoft 365, Windows Virtual Desktop, and Azure services.  User identities from Active Directory Domain Services will be imported into Azure Active Directory to maintain user login credentials.  Azure AD Connect will be installed at Contoso Healthcare's data center in order to synchronize user credentials for single sign-on.  Password Hash Synchronization will be used so that users have the ability to authenticate through the data center Active Directory services or the cloud Azure Active Directory services.

    - How will you address the secure and centralized file storage needs of the organization?
        - Azure Files is the preferred method for storage use with Windows Virtual Desktop.  In addition, FSLogix can be used in conjunction with Azure Files to manage user virtual desktop profiles.  Azure Files must deployed in the same region as the Virtual Machine pools.

    - Describe the reasons for the specific security services selected.

3. Networking

    - What region or regions will you deploy resources and why?
        - In order to decrease latency to the current Detroit and Dallas data centers, the recommended Azure Regions would be either the North Central US or Central US.  
    
    - How will you design the resource groups to support your design?
        - The entire Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure should be created within a single resource group.  This will allow for ease of management of the resources and the ability to analyze and review the consumption easily within the Azure subscription.  
       
    - How will your virtual networks (VNETs) be configured for IP addresses and subnets?
        - The resource group should be configured with at least three separate VNETs with subnets.  The first would be the VNET for the Virtual Desktop hostpool, the second will be the VNET used to connect to the on-premises network, and the third would be a VNET for a Bastion host to be used for secure virtual machine access for support.  The VNETs will be peered with only the Virtual Desktop hostpool VNET having gateway access for security.  This configuration of VNETs provides a level of isolation to the networks for security and control.

    - How will you connect to Contoso Healthcare's data centers to minimize latency and maximize security?
        - The VNET identified above to connect to the on-premises network should have an Azure Firewall that creates a site-to-site VPN connection to the primary datacenter in Detroit.  The recommendation would be to also utilize an Azure ExpressRoute connnection directly from the Detroit datacenter to Azure, if available, and the VPN be used for backup connectivity to maximize connection speed and security.

    - How will you manage and balance network traffic to virtual desktops images?
        - The VNET being used for the hostpool should have a load balancer configured as the public facing access to the hostpool virtual machine availability set.  This will secure the virtual machines from needing a public IP address and also avoid a single virtual machine from being over used with requests.

    - What will you use to identify and monitor threats on the network?
        - Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, and Advanced Threat Protection should all be turned on with actions and alerts to the security group.  The Azure Security Center standard subscription will provide a central dashboard for monitoring, locating, and alerting on common threats found in the Microsoft Threat database.

    - How would you monitor network throughput and latency over the network?
        - Turning on Network Watcher within the VNETs will provide logs and analysis of the network speeds across VNETs and to the on-premises network.

4. Windows Virtual Desktop image

    - How will the standardized desktop image be created?
        - The recommendation would be to create the standard image that Contoso Healthcare is wanting to deliver to their users, and create a VHD of that image.  Details on this process is in the links provided in the student guide.  Another option is to have an image created with Windows 10 multi-user licensing and Office365 ProPlus at the time of creating the Windows Virtual Desktop host pool, and then making adjustments to that image based on custom requirements.

    - How will applications be delivered to the desktop image?
        - To simplify the application delivery and licensing, Contoso Healthcare would like to leverage the current Citrix infrastructure that they have in place.  To accomplish this, a shortcut can be provided on the standard desktop image for the Citrix app marketplace that provides users with the applications that they are authorized to access.

    - What are the connection options for users to access the Windows Virtual Desktop image?
        - There are multiple connection options for users to access their Windows Virtual Desktop.  The Remote Desktop client application can be used in Windows 10, Windows 7, Android, macOS, or iOS.  Users can also connect through a HTML5-capable web browser.  Since we are unsure the full scope of operating systems on the 500 existing workstations within Contoso Healthcare, we will recommend connection through the web browser on desktop devices, and using the Remote Desktop app on mobile devices.

    - What are the minimum system requirements for users to access the Windows Virtual Desktop image?
        - Officially supported browsers are Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox (v55 or higher).  Windows 10, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, Windows 7, and macOS operating systems are supported.  Microsoft Remote Desktop app is available for Android and iOS mobile devices.    

5. Windows Virtual Desktop host pool
  
    - How many con-current sessions will be required to access the virtual desktop image?
        - We will design the capacity to support the full 500 workstations that were identified in our initial discussions with the customer. 

    - How many virtual machines are required to support the number of con-current sessions?
        - You should have used the Azure pricing calculator to create an initial capacity estimate.  This estimate calculated 2 DS4s v3 instances as the base availability set and 29 additional instances to scale capacity.  The example estimate can be accessed here: https://azure.com/e/42510b06f9be4721a00bd279c451352f

1. Contoso has made a substantial capital investment in their current data centers that they do not want to decommission. How can the infrastructure be architected to support the current data centers?
    - The designed solution has been architected to integrate the current application delivery configuration through Citrix into the standardized Windows Virtual Desktop image.  In addition, Azure AD Connect will be used with hash synchronization to provide a single sign-on environment between the Azure Active Directory identity management and the existing on-premises Active Directory domain.  As hardware is depreciated within the current data centers, application servers can be migrated to Azure and the Windows Virtual Desktop image can be updated for the new location of these servers.

2. The CTO at Contoso does not want to invest in new workstations and mobile devices to support the standardized desktop image. Can these devices support the new image?
    - Windows Virtual Desktop is flexible in the way that users can access their virtual desktop.  The design will utilize web browser access to the virtual desktop on workstations, and the remote desktop app on mobile devices.  

3. The CISO at Contoso needs to be convinced that data will not be exposed. How would Microsoft handle data protection?
    - The designed solution for Contoso Healthcare includes Microsoft 365 E5 with Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5.  This provides a full suite of data and information protection to classify sensitive data and audit activity.  Cloud App Security can also be used to block access to unauthorized file sharing services to avoid users from copying files to unprotected locations.  Data protection controls can be monitored through Microsoft 365 security adviser, and Azure Security Center.

4. Contoso must be able to log and audit all activity on the desktop image.  How will this be handled within the cloud and on-premises environments?
    - Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics will be activated within the Azure environment.  Azure Monitor agents will be deployed to the on-premises virtual machines to monitor activity across the entire infrastructure.

5. Connections between the cloud and existing data centers must be secure and reliable to support their requirements.  How will this be addressed and monitored?
    - The initial design will utilize a secure and encrypted site-to-site VPN connection from Azure to the Detroit data center.  An option has also been provided to utilize an Azure ExpressRoute connection to provide private dedicated connectivity from Azure to the Detroit data center.  Network Watcher will be used to monitor network traffic and throughput over the connections.  Azure Security Center and Advanced Threat Protection will be in place to monitor and alert on potential vulnerabilities and threats.
