# Implementing Windows Virtual Desktop for the enterprise hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a Windows Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and learn how-to setup a working WVD environment end-to-end in a typical Enterprise model. At the end of the lab, attendees will have deployed an Azure Active Directory Tenant with Azure AD Connect to an Active Directory Domain Controller that is running in Azure. You will also deploy the Azure infrastructure for the Windows Virtual Desktop Tenant(s), Host Pool(s) and session host(s), and connect to a WVD session utilizing different supported devices and browsers. You will publish Windows Virtual Desktops and remote apps, and configure user profiles and file shares with FSLogix.  Finally, you will configure monitoring and security for the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure and understand the steps to manage the master images.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) solution. Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Windows Virtual Desktop allows you to choose a flexible end user virtualized application or desktop delivery model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud strategy. WVD simplifies the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern and legacy desktop app experiences with unified management---without needing to host, install, configure and manage components such as diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway. WVD brings together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the only multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced IT costs while empowering today's modern digital workspace.

## Solution architecture

![This is the Solution architecture diagram as described in the text below.](images/wvdsolutiondiagramv2.png "Solution architecture") 

This diagram shows a Windows Virtual Desktop architecture with on-premises servers for Active Directory.  In the diagram, the host pools are providing the WVD session to the different supported devices. Azure Monitor, Network Watcher, and Log Analytics are monitoring and logging activity and performance metrics.

## Requirements

Before you start setting up your Windows Virtual Desktop workspace, make sure you have the following items:

-   The Azure Active Directory tenant ID for Windows Virtual Desktop users.

-   A global administrator account within the Azure Active Directory tenant.

    -   This also applies to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) organizations that are creating a Windows Virtual Desktop workspace for their customers. If you are in a CSP organization, you must be able to sign in as global administrator of the customer\'s Azure Active Directory tenant.

    -   The administrator account must be sourced from the Azure Active Directory tenant in which you are trying to create the Windows Virtual Desktop workspace. This process does not support Azure Active Directory B2B (guest) accounts.

    -   The administrator account must be a work or school account.

-   An Azure subscription.

    -   Enough Quota Cores to build four 4-core servers.

    -   Access to the Azure Active Directory Global Admin account for your new or existing Azure Active Directory Tenant.

    -   Owner rights on all Azure subscription(s).

## Before the hands-on lab

-   Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide before continuing to the lab exercises.
  
-   Make sure to keep track of what user accounts you are using and where you are using them.

-   Regions and locations, make sure to stay consistent as much as possible.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

Duration:  60 minutes

In this exercise you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Windows Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the WVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance security.

### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the list.

3.  On the Resource groups blade, Select on the resource group name that you created in the **Before the HOL** template deployment.

4.  On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and Select on it. Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

    ![Find the public IP address for the domain controller VM](images/publicip.png "Public IP address for Domain Controller VM")

5.  On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field. Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC** and hit enter.

    ![Open the Run dialog window to run MSTSC](images/run.png "Run on Windows") 

7.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP address from the previous step. Select **Connect**.

    ![The Window for Remote Desktop Connection will open to enter the public IP address for the domain controller VM.](images/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection") 

8.  When prompted, sign in with the AD domain UPN credentials. For example, if you used the ARM template from [Before HOL setup guide](), the credentials will be something along the lines of: [adadmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:adadmin@MyADDomain.com) with the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. If prompted, Select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning.

    >**Note**: This is the Active Directory account from the ARM template, not the Azure AD Global Admin account. If you have trouble signing in, try typing the credentials in manually, as copy and paste may include an unnecessary space, which will cause authentication to fail.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

In an effort to simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and Select **On**.

    ![Within the Local Server properties in server manager, locate Enhanced Security configuration.](images/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and Select **OK**.

    ![When you select the current configuration, a new window will open that will allow you to disable the enhanced security configuration.](images/disablesecurity.png "Disable enhanced security configuration")

### Task 3: Creating a domain admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, Select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![Find Tools on the uppert right corner to access the Server Manager Tools.](images/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![Find the folder path for users, and right-click to add a new user](images/newUser.png "Folder path for new user") 

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![A window will open with the fields to complete for a new user.](images/newuserobject.png "Create a new user")


    ![The next window will allow you to assign a password.](images/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window") 

    ![The final screen of the wizard will allow you to review and finish the new user setup.](images/finishnewuser.png "Finish new user setup")

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on the new user account object and select **Add to a group**.

    ![When the new user is created, we will find that user name and right-click to add the user to a group.](images/addusertogroup.png "Add new user to a group")

5.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and Select **OK**.
   
    >**Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 

    ![In the next window, we will add this user to the Domain Admins group.](images/addusertodomainadmins.png "Add user to Domain Admins group")

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and open it.

    ![Find the Azure AD Connect icon on the Domain controller VM desktop.](images/azureadconnect.png "Azure AD Connect desktop icon")

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![This will take you to the Azure AD connect set up screen.](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD connect set up screen") 

3.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. For example: [azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and the correct password. Select **Next**.

    ![After selecting "Use express settings", the next window will require you to enter your Azure Active Directory username and password.](images/adconnectazuresub.png "Azure AD Connect - Azure AD login")
    >**Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

4.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter in the Active Directory credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, if you used the ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials will be something along the lines of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Select **Next**.

    ![In the next window, enter the AD DS domain and admin username and password.](images/azureadconnectdclogin.png "Azure AD Connect - Domain login")
    
    >**Note**: If you copy and paste the password, please ensure that there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

5.  Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

    ![In the next window, select the box to continue without matching all UPN suffixes and select next to continue.](images/azureadsigninconfig.png "Azure AD sign-in configuration")

    ![In the final setup window, select the box to start the synchronization process and select install.](images/azureadready.png "Azure AD Connect Ready to configure")

6.  After a few minutes the Azure AD Connect installation will complete.
    Select **Exit**.

    ![Once installation is complete the Configuration complete window will be present.](images/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")
7.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

8.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

9.  Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it from the list.

10. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

11. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized.  

    ![This image shows the list of users that you should see in Azure Active Directory that were synchronized from Active Directory with Azure AD Connect](images/adconnectsync.png)

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.


## Exercise 2: Create Azure AD groups for WVD

Duration:  30 minutes

In this exercise you will be working with groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to assist in managing access assignment to your application groups in WVD. The new ARM portal for WVD supports access assignment using Azure AD groups. This capability greatly simplifies access management. Groups will also be leveraged in this guide to manage
share permissions in Azure Files for FSLogix.

You will be creating three Azure AD groups to manage access to the different application groups; Personal, Pooled, and RemoteApp. For this guide we will only create a single group for RemoteApps, but in a production scenario it is more common to use separate groups based on the app or persona defined by the customer. Be sure to make note of the groups you create, as they will be used in later exercises.

It is also important to keep in mind that these groups can also originate from the Windows Active Directory environment and synchronize via Azure AD Connect. This will be another common scenario for customers that already have processes defined on-premises for group management.

### Task 1: Creating Azure AD groups

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left and select **+ New group**.

4.  On the New Group page, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Pooled Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![Create a new security group type and provide the WVD Pooled Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup2.png "New Group Window")

5.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Remote App All Users

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![Create a new security group type and provide the WVD Remote App All users for the group name.](images/newGroup1.png "New Group Window")

6.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Persistent Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![Create a new security group type and provide the WVD Persistent Desktop user for the group name.](images/newGroup3.png "New Group Window")

7. Confirm that the groups have been added by going to **Azure Active Directory**, selecting **Groups**.  Scroll down to the bottom of the list of groups and the three groups that you created should be listed.

    ![Go to Azure Active Directory Groups to view the list of groups.](images/aadgroups.png)

    ![Scroll to the bottom of the list to view the three new groups that were created.](images/aadnewgroups.png)

### Task 2: Assign users to groups

Now that the Azure AD groups are in place, we will assign users for testing. Once the groups are populated, we can leverage them for assigning access to WVD resources once they are created.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the **Azure Active Directory** page, select **Groups** on the left and select the **WVD Persistent Desktop User** group.

4.  Select **Members** and **+ Add Members**

    ![Add members to the persistent desktop user group from within the Azure AD blade.](images/newMember.png)

5.  In the search field, enter the name of a User to add **Select** to add them to the group.

6.  Repeat steps 4-6 for the **WVD Pooled Desktop User** and **WVD Remote App All Users** groups.

    At this point you have three new Azure AD groups with members assigned. Make a note of the group names and accounts you added for use later in this guide. These groups will be used to assign access to WVD application groups.

    ![Here is the list of users that you should be adding to each of the groups.](images/aadwvdusers.png)


## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise you will be creating an Azure File share and enabling SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for WVD users. At the end of this exercise you will have the following components:

-   A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

-   A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

-   AD authentication enabled for your Azure storage account.

-   Permissions applied for user access to the file share.

|              |            |

### Task 1: Create a storage account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![From the search menu bar, search for storage accounts.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

3.  On the Storage Accounts window that appears, Select **+ Add**.

4.  Fill in the required parameters for the storage account. Refer to the following example for more information on the available parameters. Make a note that contains the values you provide for **Resource group** and **Storage account name**. These will be needed later in the exercise.

    ![Select the Add icon to create a new storage account.](images/addstorageaccount.png "Add a storage account")

    ![On this blade, enter the information to create a new storage account.](images/createstorageaccount.png "Create a storage account")

5.  Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.

6.  Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share

1.  At the top of the Azure Portal page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the Overview page for your Storage account, select **File shares**.

    ![Once the storage account is created, from the overview blade, select File shares.](images/storagefileshare.png "Create a File share")

4.  On the File shares blade, Select **+ File Share**.

    ![Select the add icon in File shares to create a new file share.](images/addfileshare.png "Add file share")

5.  Enter a Name the new file share, enter a quota in gigabits, and Select **Create**.

    ![Give the file share a name and a storage quota in gigabits.](images/newfileshare.png "New File share")
    
    >**Note**: The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD authentication for your storage account

**Prerequisites**

1.  The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain joined computer. The **AzFilesHybrid** module uses the AD PowerShell module, so running from a server is preferred.

    ![Locate the PowerShell ISE icon on the VM desktop and select it to open.](images/openpowersellise.png "Open PowerShell ISE")

2.  The account used in this task needs to meet the following requirements:

    -    Synchronized with Azure AD.

    -    Permissions to create user or computer objects in Active Directory.

    -    Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task we will be completing the steps on the Domain Controller in Azure using an account that has been assigned Global Administrator and Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this back as long as you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1.  From a domain joined computer, download and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases).

    ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

7.  Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid. For example:

    ```
    cd C:\Users\ADAdmin\Documents\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![The path to the file should be the documents folder location in file explorer](images/filelocation.png)

8.  Install the Az PowerShell module.

    ```  
    if ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -eq 'Desktop' -and (Get-Module -Name AzureRM -ListAvailable)) {
    Write-Warning -Message ('Az module not installed. Having both the AzureRM and ' +
      'Az modules installed at the same time is not supported.')
    } else {
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    }
    ```

9.  Install the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```
    .\CopyToPSPath.ps1
    ```

10. Import the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```  
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![After running these commands, the results will look like this screenshot.](images/azimportresults.png)
    
11. Sign in with an account that meets the prerequisites.

    ```
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

12.  Create the following PowerShell variables replacing the subscription id, resource group name, and storage account with the information specific to your lab environment:
    

        ```
        $SubscriptionId = "\<subscription-id\>\"
        $ResourceGroupName = "\<resource-group-name\>\"
        $StorageAccountName = "\<storage-account-name\>\"
        ```



        >**Note**: The Resource Group Name and Storage Account Name were assigned in Task 1.

        >**Note**: You can run **Get-AzSubscription** to lookup the available subscription names.

        ![Here is where you would find the subscription id when running the Get-AzSubscription command.](images/subscriptionid.png)


13.  Select the target subscription for the current session.
  

        ```
        Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
        ```

14. Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain.

    ```
    Join-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
   
    ```

    >**Note**: You will be prompted to enter the Azure storage account name after you run this command.  The prompt will look like the below screenshot.

    ![This is the prompt to enter the Azure storage account after running the join command.](images/enterstorage.png)

15. When the script completes, you will be provided with confirmation that you are connected to the storage account.

    ![This is the confirmation of the storage account connection.](images/storageconfirmed.png)

16. Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory Users and Computers** by going to Domain controllers and looking for the computer object for Azure storage account.

    ![Here is what the newly created computer object looks like in Active Directory.](images/confirmnewobject.png)

17. Confirm that the feature is enabled.

        ```
        $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
        ```

18.  List the directory service of the selected service account.
 
        ```
        $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
        ```

19. List the directory domain information if the storage account has enabled AD authentication for file shares.

    ```
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
    ```

    ![Here is what the responses should be when running the previous Powershell tasks.](images/confirmpowershell.png)


20. You can also confirm activation with your domain by navigating to the Azure portal, going to the storage account and selecting **Configuration** under **Settings**. Refer to the group on Active Directory (AD), as shown in the example below.

    ![In the storage account configuration, you will see that Active Directory Domain Services is enabled](images/portalconfirm.png)

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure share permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level permissions to users and/or groups:

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader:** allows read access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor:** allows read, write, and delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor:** allows read, write, delete and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access that a particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create 4 new security groups in Active Directory to manage share permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![Open the window on the domain controller VM server manager and go to the Active Directory users and computers to create a new security group.](images/adgroups.png "Create new groups")

2.  Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that is synchronized with Azure AD:

    -   **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

        ![Create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Contributor.](images/azfcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

        ![Create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor.](images/azfelevcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Reader**

        ![Create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Reader.](images/azfreader.png "AZF FSLogix Reader")

    -   **WVD Users**

        ![Create a new group object named WVD User.](images/wvduser.png "WVD User")

3.  Add the WVD administrative account that you created previously to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file share permissions.

    ![Find the WVD admin user that you created previously and right-click to add to a group](images/chooseadmin.png)

4.  Type **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **Ok** to save.

    ![Here is how to add the AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor group to this user.](images/addadmin.png)

5.  Add the group **WVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix Contributor** by going to the Builtin groups, locating WVDUsers and righ-click to **Add to a group**.
  
    ![This shows how you would find the WVD Users group and add it to a group.](images/wvduseraddtogroup.png)

    ![Here is where you enter the FSLogix contributor group and check the name before adding.](images/wvduseraddgroup.png)

6.  Add user accounts to the group **WVD Users** by selecting **OrgUsers** and choosing all of the users in the list.  Select all of the users and right-click to add them to a group. These users will have access to use FSLogix profiles. Also be sure to add the **ADAdmin** user to these groups.

    ![Go to the list of users in the organization, select the users and add them to the WVD Users group.](images/wvdaddusers.png "Add users to the WVD users group")

7.  Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD.  These groups can be verified by going to **Groups** within **Azure Active Directory** and looking for the names in the list.

    ![Here is where you would verify that the groups that were created on the domain controller have synchronized with Azure AD](images/newgroups.png)

    With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This will enable to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

8.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![From the Azure portal, search for storage accounts on the search bar.](images/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

9.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the Storage account you created in Task 1.

10. On the blade for your storage account, locate and Select on **File shares** .

11. On the File shares blade, Select on your file share.

12. Select **Access Control (IAM)**.

13. Select **+ Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

    ![In the storage account, under access control, locate and select add under add a role assignment.](images/addroleassign.png "Add Azure AD Role assignment")

14. On the Add role assignment fly out, fill in the following options and Select **Save**.

    -    **Role:** Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor

    -    **Assign access to:** Azure AD user, group, or service principal

    -    **Select:** AZF FSLogix Contributor

15. Repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining two roles.

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor \> AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Reader \> AZF FSLogix Reader

    ![Add the storage file data SMB share contributor role to the three AZF FSLogix users that were created within Active Directory.](images/azureadroleassign.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

### Task 5: Configure NTFS permissions for the file share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that
determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows icacls or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your storage account key.

>**Note**: In order to complete this task, you will need to disable secure transfer in the storage account.  This can be accessed from the storage account **Configuration** and selecting **Disabled** under **Secure transfer required**.  Select **Save** to save the changes.

![In the configuration, you will disable secure transfer required and save](images/disablesecuretransfer.png)

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the Storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**, select **Properties**. Locate the **Primary File Service Endpoint** address. This is the path you will use to access your file share. 

    ![Use the storage account properties blade to find the storage account path.](images/storagefileendpoint.png)

4.  Reformat the path to UNC and copy it to a notepad file. For example:

    https://mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net/ ==
    \\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>

    ![Here is what the reformatted name should look like in notepad on the domain controller.](images/notepadreformatted.png)

5.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. Copy and paste the value for **key1** to the same notepad file.

    ![Here is where you will find the storage account key to copy to the notepad.](images/copykey.png)

6.  From a domain joined computer, open a standard command prompt and mount your file share using the storage account key. **Do not** use an elevated command prompt or the mount point will not be visible in File Explorer. 

    ![Go to the search on Windows to find and open the Command prompt.](images/opencommandprompt.png)
     
    >**Note**: Refer to the following examples to prepare your command. Be sure to enter spaces where (space) is noted:
    net use z:(space) \\\\\<storage-account-name\>.file.core.windows.net\\\<share-name>(space) <storage-account-key\>(space) /user:Azure\\\<storage-account-name\>

        Example with sample values:
                
        net use z: \\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\FSLogix uPCvi+gP2qbCQcn3EATgbALE0H8nxhspyLRO2Nf9Hm2gMxfn/389/M33XHh7YEqNJ2GhbJXgStiifPwMBXk38Q== user:Azure\\mydomainazfiles
        

    ![From the command prompt, run the script list above to connect the storage account as a network drive.](images/cmdprompt.png "Command Prompt script for mapping drive")

    >**Note**: This is an SMB connection on port 445. Most consumer ISPs block this port by default. If you are doing this in your lab and experience issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a domain joined VM in Azure.

    ![After the net use command is completed successfully, you will receive a prompt that it was completed successfully.  You will also be able to see the drive as a network location in file explorer.](images/successfulstoragemap.png)

7.  Open **File Explorer**, right-click on the **Z:** drive and select **Properties**.

8.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

    ![In the properties for the drive, select the security folder and select advanced.](images/drivesecurity.png)

9.  Select **Add** and add each of the AD security groups you created in Task 4 with the appropriate permissions.  Select check names as each is entered to verify the connection.

    ![Select add in security settings to add new objects.](images/addsecurity.png)

    >**Note**: The images shows all of the objects that need to be added but only one can be added at a time.  Add one and then repeat the process until all four are added.

10. Select **OK** to save your changes.

    ![Choose select a principal to open the select user, computer, service account, or group window.  In the enter the object name window, enter the FSLogix groups that were created previously.  Check names and select ok.](images/addobjects.png)

    ![After adding all four objects as principals, they will be in the list of permission entries.](images/addsecuritycomplete.png)



### Task 6: Configure NTFS permissions for the containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions. There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions for use with Profile Containers and Office Container. Below is one configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn't require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile types and assign the recommended permissions.

1.  Navigate to the networked drive in File explorer

    ![This is where you will find the network drive that you mounted in the previous task.](images/networkdrive.png)

2.  Create three new folder directories in the root share.

    -    **Profiles**

    -    **ODFC**

    -    **MSIX**

    ![After adding these folders, file explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](images/newfolders.png)

3.  Right-click on the **Profiles** directory and select **Properties**.

4.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

5.  Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![Here is the screen that you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png)

6.  Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** and check **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![These are the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png)

7.  Select **Add** and add **Creator owner**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![This is what you willl see to add the creator owner object.](images/addcreatorowner.png)

    ![These are the permissions for full control to the creator owner.](images/addfullcontrolcreator.png)

8.  Select **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant the following special permissions to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    -   Traverse folder / execute file

    -   List folder / read data

    -   Read attributes

    -   Create folders / append data

    ![This is what the special permissions for WVD user should look like.](images/userfolderpermissions.png)

9.  Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

    ![This is the list of permission objects that were just created.](images/permissionscomplete.png)

10. Repeat steps 3-9 for the **ODFC** directory.

11. Right-click on the **MSIX** directory and select **Properties**.

12. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

13. Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

    ![Here is the screen that you would remove the inherited permissions.](images/removeinheritedperm.png)

14. Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![These are the selections that should be complete before selecting ok.](images/addfullcontrol.png)

15. Select **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant **Read & execute** to **Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container**. Select **OK**.

    ![These are the custom permissions for the WVD users on the MSIX folder](images/msixwvdusers.png)

16. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

17. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

Your Azure Files Share is now ready for FSLogix profile containers. Copy the UNC path and add it to your FSLogix deployment (image, GPO, etc..).

## Exercise 4: Create a master image for WVD

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise we are going to walk through the process of creating a master image for your WVD host pools. The basic concept for a master image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on mandatory updates, applications and configurations. There are many ways to create and manage images for WVD. The steps covered in this exercise are going to walk you through a basic build and capture process that includes core applications and recommended configuration options for WVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  On the Azure portal home page, Select **Create a resource**.

3.  On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**. Select **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909** and Select **Create**.


    ![This window will display the creation of a New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909.](images/windows10VM.png "New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909")

    >**Note**: In this exercise we are selecting a base Windows 10 image to start with, and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version based on your requirements.

4.  On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields and create the VM by selecting **Review + create**.

    ![This is what your configuration should look like.](images/win10vmcreate.png)

    >**Note**: Make a note of the **Username** and **Password** used to create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after creation.

    >**Note**: This guide does not walk through the process of creating a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to allow **RDP (3389)** , or have a bastion host deployed for remote access.

    ![In the "Create a virtual machine" page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM, allow port 3389 as an inbound port.](images/windows10VMcreate.png "The 'Create a virtual machine' page within the Azure portal for the Windows 10 VM")

5.  Once the VM is successfully deployed, go to the resource, and connect using RDP. Sign in using the credentials you supplied when creating the VM.

    ![Select connect in the Windows 10 VM overview to RDP to the vm.](images/connectwin10vm.png)

6.  Download the RDP file and open the RDP file to connect.

    ![This image shows the download RDP button and the file that is downloaded to connect to the vm.](images/connectrdp.png)

### Task 2: Run Windows Update

Despite the Azure support teams best efforts, the Marketplace images are not always up to date. The best and most secure practice is to keep your master image up to date.

1.  From your master image VM, open the **Settings** app and select **Updates & Security**.

    ![On the new Windows 10 VM image, go to settings window and select update and security.](images/w10VMSettings.png "The settings window within the Windows 10 VM")

2.  Install all missing updates, rebooting as necessary.

3.  Once the VM is fully patched, the Windows Update Settings page should resemble the following screenshot.

    ![After checking for and running any updates, the settings window showing that Windows update is up to date.](images/w10vmSettingsUpToDate.png "The settings window showing that Windows update is up to date")

### Task 3: Prepare WVD image

**Introduction to the script**

The authors for this content have developed a scripted solution to assist in automating some common baseline image build tasks. The script includes a UI form, enabling you to quickly select which actions to perform. The end result will be a custom master image that incorporates Microsoft's main business applications, along with the necessary
policies and settings for an optimized user experience.

The script and related tools are maintained in GitHub - [Download Link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations) 

https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations 

For additional documentation about the script (e.g. parameters, functions, etc.), refer to the comments in **Prepare-WVDImage.ps1**.

For troubleshooting script execution, refer to the following log directory on the target machine: **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep**.

This script leverages the [Local Group Policy Object (LGPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool) tool in the [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10) to apply settings in the image. The settings are documented and exported on the target machine under **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep\\LGPO**. This approach was taken to simplify troubleshooting, enabling you to leverage Group Policy Results.

The UI form offers the following actions:

**Office 365 ProPlus**

## Exercise 5: Create a host pool for personal desktops

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise we will be creating a Windows Virtual Desktop host pool for pooled desktops. This is a set of computers or hosts which operate on an as-needed basis. In a pooled configuration we will be hosting multiple non-persistent sessions, with no user profile information stored locally. This is where FSLogix Profile Containers provide the users profile to the host dynamically. This provides the ability for an organization to fully utilize the compute resources on a single host and lower the total overhead, cost, and number of remote workstations.

  |              |            | 

### Task 1: Connecting with the HTML5 web client

1.  Open a supported web browser.

2.  Navigate to the https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient.

    >**Note**: You will be asked to login when you access the above URL.  The credentials that you use are those from the lab.

3.  Sign in using a synchronized identity that has been assigned to an application group.
    >**Note**: If you added the **AAD DC Administrators** to the groups in the previous exercises, you will be able to use your Global Administrator information.  This **must** be a user that is syncronized with the AD DS with Azure AD Connect.  To verify, go to Azure Active Directory users and verify the directory sync users.

    ![Here is where you would verify that a user is syncronized with the domain controller.](images/confirmsync.png)

    ![Select to use another account to enter the login email.](images/useanotheraccount.png)

    ![Enter the email address for the lab Azure tenant.](images/signinwithtenantadmin.png)

    ![Enter the password for the username that you entered.](images/enterpw.png)

4.  Select an available resource from the web client. In this example we will connect to a host pool containing pooled desktop.

    ![Once you login to the portal, you will see the apps that are available for you to use.](images/appsavailable.png)

5.  On the **Access local resources** prompt, review the available options for and Select **Allow**.

    ![Here you will select the default desktop and allow local resources.](images/allowlocal.png)

6.  On the **Enter your credentials** prompt, sign in using the same account from Step 3 and Select **Submit**. 
   
    >**Note**: The username and password to login to the WVD desktop will be credentials from the domain controller user name and password created upon initial deployment.  If you need the user email, RDP into the domain controller VM and find the user in the **Active Directory Users and Groups** and **OrgUsers**.

    ![On the domain controller VM, you can find the username here.](images/dcusername.png)

    ![Enter the username from the domain controller and the password created during initial lab deployment.](images/dccreds.png)

7.  Once connected, validate the components relative to your configuration. The desktop should show icons for Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Teams.  When you go to the Windows start menu, you can find the Office applications.

    ![The desktop WVD image should look like this.](images/wvddesktopimage.png)


**Troubleshooting**

**Web client stops responding or disconnects**

Try connecting using another browser or client.

If issues continue even after you\'ve switched browsers, the problem may not be with your browser, but with your network. We recommend you contact network support.

**Web client keeps prompting for credentials**

If the Web client keeps prompting for credentials, follow these instructions:

1.  Confirm the web client URL is correct.

2.  Confirm that the credentials you\'re using are for the Windows Virtual Desktop environment tied to the URL.

3.  Clear browser cookies.

4.  Clear browser cache.

5.  Open your browser in Private mode.



## Exercise 8: Setup monitoring for WVD

Duration:  45 minutes

In this exercise we will setup monitoring for our WVD host pools. There are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role; troubleshooting, performance, security, etc. There are also multiple components that make up the WVD service, which can add some variation on how customers implement monitoring (e.g. adding additional third-party solutions). By the end of this exercise you will have the following monitoring capabilities enabled:

-   Diagnostic logging for the WVD service

-   Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

-   Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each of the monitoring capabilities covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC controls, query performance, report development, etc. For WVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single dedicated workspace.

In this exercise we will create a dedicated workspace for our environment. If you already have a workspace created, move on to Task 2.

### Task 2: Enabling diagnostic logging for WVD

Like many other Azure services, WVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts. In order to enable diagnostic data collection, you need to enable it for each ARM object that you want to monitor (e.g. Host pools, Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each WVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available. For example, host pool objects will have a different set of options then Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data category and their associated objects.

  |              |            |     |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Category**  |**Description**  |                                                                 **ARM Object(s)** |
  Checkpoint   |       Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on. |  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces
  Connection    |      When users initiate and complete connections to the service.    |                                                                                                                                             Host pools
  Error       |        Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you as long as the information is joined with the activities.     |               Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces |
  Feed   |             Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?      |                                                                                     Workspaces |
  Host Registration  | Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?       |                                                                                 Host pools| 
  Management     |     Track whether attempts to change Windows Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?       |                  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces

### Task 6: Enabling Azure Monitor for the session hosts

Azure Monitor is leveraged with WVD to monitor the performance and health of your session host VMs. This feature can be enabled for Azure VMs in a number of ways. In this exercise we will walk through enabling Azure Monitor on VMs using the Azure portal. Refer to the following links for guidance on automation.


1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**virtual machines**\". Select **Virtual Machines** from the list.

    ![From the Azure portal search bar, search for virtual machines and select the service.](images/searchvm.png "Search for Virtual machines")

3.  On the Virtual Machines blade, locate a session host VM and Select on the name.

4.  On the blade for the virtual machine, under **Monitoring**, select **Insights**.

    ![From the domaing controller VM, select insights under monitoring in the menu.](images/vminsights.png "Virtual Machine Insights")

5.  On the Insights blade, Select **Enable**. This will initiate a validation check.

    ![In the insights blade, select enable to enable insights on the virtual machine.](images/enableinsights.png "Enable VM Insights")

    >**Note**: The virtual machine must be running to enable Azure Monitor.

6.  On the Insights setup page, fill in the following information and Select **Enable**.

    -    **Workspace Subscription:** Select the desired subscription.

    -    **Choose a Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the workspace used in the previous task.

    ![In the enable insights blade, select the Log Analytics workspace and select enable.](images/vminsightsconfig.png "Log Analytics workspace configuration for VM Insights")

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. This can take 5-10 minutes. Once complete, you will see the following items configured on the VM:

**New VM Extensions Added**. Two new extensions are added to the VM Extensions blade in Azure.

**New Monitoring Agents Installed**. Two new agents are installed on the VM.

**Monitoring Agent Configured for Log Analytics** The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is configured for your log analytics workspace.

At this point you should have Azure Monitor enabled on at least one session host VM. To enable Azure Monitor for additional session hosts, repeat the above steps. For automation, leverage Azure Policy or PowerShell to enable monitoring on multiple VMs.

**Example Kusto Queries**

For a list of example queries, refer to the following Docs article:

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 

**Troubleshooting**

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. The example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Windows Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of WVD there may be challenges with either having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.
