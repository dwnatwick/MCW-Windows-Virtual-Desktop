## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Windows Virtual Desktop
(WVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/)  *solution* .
Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Windows Virtual Desktop
allows you to choose a flexible end user virtualized application or
desktop delivery model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud
strategy. WVD simplifies the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern
and legacy desktop app experiences with unified management---without
needing to host, install, configure and manage components such as
diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway. WVD brings
together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the only
multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced
IT costs while empowering today's modern digital workspace.

**Helpful Hints for this Lab**

-   Verify that you have a valid Azure DevOps account to be able to access the following link: https://servicescode.visualstudio.com/WVD%20Bootcamp%20Labs/_wiki/wikis/WVD%20Deployment%20Guide/2949/Windows-Virtual-Desktop-on-Azure-Lab

-   Take your time, there is a lot of information to digest and go
    through

-   Make sure to keep track of what user accounts you are using and
    where you are using them

-   Regions and locations, make sure to stay consistent as much as
    possible

-   Terminology is important

**Solution architecture**

At the end of the lab, attendees will have deployed an Azure Active
Directory Tenant, Azure infrastructure, Active Directory, Active
Directory Domain Controller using an ARM template from GitHub, Windows
Virtual Desktop Tenant(s), Host Pool(s) and session host(s).


## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

In this exercise you will be configuring [[Azure AD
Connect]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect) .
With Windows Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the WVD tenant
environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain
must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of
objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller
deployed in Azure.

*Note:* RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is
not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better
security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time
access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance
security.


### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  Sign in to the [[Azure Portal]](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the
    list.

3.  On the Resource groups blade, click on the **Infra** resource group.

4.  On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available
    resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and click on it.
    Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

5.  On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field.
    Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window,
    type **MSTSC** and hit enter.

    ![Run on Windows](images/run.png)

7.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP
    address from the previous step. Click **Connect**.

    ![Window for Remote Desktop Connection](images/remoteDesktop.png)

8.  When prompted, sign in with the AD domain UPN credentials. For
    example, if you used the ARM template from [[Exercise
    3]](https://servicescode.visualstudio.com/WVD%20Bootcamp%20Labs/_wiki/wikis/WVD%20Deployment%20Guide?wikiVersion=GBmaster&pagePath=%2FWindows%20Virtual%20Desktop%20on%20Azure%20Lab%2FPrerequisites%2FExercise%203%3A%20Deploying%20Azure%20Infrastructure%20and%20AD%20DS),
    the credentials will be something along the lines
    of: [**[adadmin\@MyADDomain.com]**](mailto:adadmin@MyADDomain.com) with
    the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. If prompted, click **Yes** to
    accept the RDP certification warning.

**Note:** This is the Active Directory account from the ARM template,
not the Azure AD Global Admin account. If you have trouble signing in,
try typing the credentials in manually, as copy and paste may include an
unnecessary space, which will cause authentication to fail.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

In an effort to simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by
disabling [[IE Enhanced
Security]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc) .

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it
    does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and
    click **On**.

    ![Local Server properties within server manager](images/IEESC.png)
4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window,
    under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and
    click **OK**.

### Task 3: Creating a Domain Admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain
administrator
account [*[ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com]*](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com).
This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set
to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible
to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, click **Tools** in the upper right corner and
    select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![Server Manager Tools](images/serverMangerTools.png)

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click
    the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the
    menu.

    ![Folder path for new user](images/newUser.png)

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![New User Wizard window](images/newUserWizard.png)

    *Tip:* This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of
the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck
the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-click on the new user
    account object and select **Add to a group**.

5.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and
    click **OK**.

**Note:** This account will be used during the host pool creation
process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin
permissions will simplify the lab. However, any Active Directory account
that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done
using [[Active Directory Delegate
Control.]](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/) 

-   Create computer objects

-   Delete computer object

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure
    AD Connect** and double-click on it.

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen
select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![Azure AD connect set up screen](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png)

3.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin
    credentials. For
    example: [**[azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com]**](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and
    the correct password. Click **Next**.

    **Note:** This is the account associated with your Azure subsciption.

4.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter in the Active Directory
    credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, if you used the
    ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials
    will be something along the lines
    of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with
    the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Click **Next**

**Note:** If you copy and paste the password, please ensure that there
are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

5.  Click **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

6.  After a few minutes the Azure AD Connect installation will complete.
    Click **Exit**.

    ![The Configuration is completed window](images/AADCcomplete.png)
7.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few
    minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

8.  Sign in to the [[Azure
    Portal]](https://portal.azure.com/) .

9.  Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it
    from the list.

10. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**,
    select **Users**.

11. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test
    accounts have synchronized, as shown below.

**Note:** It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects
to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.

**What\'s New in the Spring 2020 Update?**

On April 30th, the Spring update for Windows Virtual Desktop entered
public preview. This gives everyone the opportunity to start playing
with the new features and capabilities. There are number of significant
enhancements that customers are going to be eager to get their hands on.

Tom Hickling and Christiaan Brinkhoff have both published excellent
writeups on the Spring update, including a breakdown on the core changes
and new features. For more information we encourage you to check out
their blog posts:

## Exercise 2: Create Azure AD Groups for WVD

In this exercise you will be working with groups in Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD) to assist in managing access assignment to your
application groups in WVD. The new ARM portal for WVD supports access
assignment using Azure AD groups. This capability greatly simplifies
access management. Groups will also be leveraged in this guide to manage
share permissions in Azure Files for FSLogix.

You will be creating 3 Azure AD groups to manage access to the different
application groups -- Personal, Pooled, and RemoteApp. For this guide we
will only create a single group for RemoteApps, but in a production
scenario it is more common to use separate groups based on the app or
persona defined by the customer. Be sure to make note of the groups you
create, as they will be used in later exercises.

It is also important to keep in mind that these groups can also
originate from the Windows Active Directory environment and synchronize
via Azure AD Connect. This will be another common scenario for customers
that already have processes defined on-prem for group management.

    Contacts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/concept-azure-ad-connect-sync-user-and-contacts) 

### Task 1: Creating Azure AD Groups

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field,
    type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active
    Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left
    and select **+ New group**.

4.  On the New Group page, fill in the following options and
    click **Create**.

-    **Group type:** Security

-    **Group name:** WVD Pooled Desktop User

-    **Membership type:** Assigned

![New Group window](images/newGroup2.png)

1.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and
    click **Create**.

-    **Group type:** Security

-    **Group name:** WVD Remote App All Users

-    **Membership type:** Assigned

![New Group window](images/newGroup1.png)

1.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and
    click **Create**.

-    **Group type:** Security

-    **Group name:** WVD Persistent Desktop User

-    **Membership type:** Assigned

![](images/newGroup3.png)

### Task 2: Assign Users to Groups

Now that the Azure AD groups are in place, we will assign users for
testing. Once the groups are populated, we can leverage them for
assigning access to WVD resources once they are created.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field,
    type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active
    Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left
    and select the desired group.

4.  Select **Members** and **+ Add Members**

![Azure AD blade](images/newMember.png)

5.  In the search field, enter the name of a User to add
    click **Select** to add them to the group.

6.  Repeat steps 4-6 for the other 2 groups.

At this point you have 3 new Azure AD groups with members assigned. Make
a note of the group names and accounts you added for use later in this
guide. These groups will be used to assign access to WVD application
groups.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

There are multiple solutions available for storing FSLogix profiles
containers.

-   Windows File Server - [Create a profile container for a host pool
    using a file
    share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-user-profile) 

-   NetApp Files - [Create an FSLogix profile container for a host pool
    using Azure NetApp
    Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-fslogix-profile-container) 

-   Azure Files - [Create an FSLogix profile container with Azure
    Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-profile-container-adds) 

In this exercise you will be creating an Azure Files share and enabling
SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a
platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for
hosting FSLogix containers for WVD users. At the end of this exercise
you will have the following components:

-   A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

-   A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

-   AD authentication enabled for your Azure storage account.

-   Permissions applied for user access to the file share.

### Task 1: Create a Storage Account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an
Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in
the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field,
    type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the
    list.

3.  On the Storage Accounts window that appears, click **+ Add**.

4.  Fill in the required parameters for the storage account. Refer to
    the following example for more information on the available
    parameters. Make a note that contains the values you provide
    for **Resource group** and **Storage account name**. These will be
    needed later in the exercise.

    ![](images/storacc.png)

5.  Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings
    and create the account.

6.  Click **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share

1.  At the top of the Azure Portal page, in the **Search
    resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage
    accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, click on the storage account you
    created in Task 1.

3.  On the Overview page for your Storage account, select **File
    shares**.

4.  On the File shares blade, click **+ File Share**.

5.  Enter a Name the new file share and click **Create**.

**Note:** The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can
be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD Authentication for your Storage Account

**Prerequisites**

1.  The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain joined
    computer. The AzFilesHybrid module use the AD PowerShell module, so
    running from a server is preferred.

2.  PowerShell version 5.0+ installed.

3.  The account used in this task needs to meet the following
    requirements:

    -    Synchronized with Azure AD.

    -    Permissions to create user or computer objects in Active
        Directory.

    -    Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task we will be completing the steps on the Domain Controller in
Azure using an account that has been assigned Global Administrator and
Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this
back as long as you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1.  From a domain joined computer, download and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid
    module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases) .

2.  Open an elevated PowerShell ISE window.

3.  Configure the PowerShell execution policy **Unrestricted** for the
    current user.

    ```pwsh
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

4.  Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid. For example:

    ```pwsh
    cd C:\\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

6.  Install the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```pwsh
    .\\CopyToPSPath.ps1
    ```

8.  Import the AzFilesHybrid module

    ```pwsh  
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

10. Sign in with an account that meets the prerequisites.

    ```pwsh
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

12. Create the following PowerShell variables.

    ```pwsh
    $SubscriptionId = "\<subscription-id\>\"
    $ResourceGroupName = "\<resource-group-name\>\"
    $StorageAccountName = "\<storage-account-name\>\"
    ```

**Note:** The Resource Group Name and Storage Account Name were assigned
in Task 1.

**Note:** You can run **Get-AzSubscription** to lookup the available
subscription names.

1.  Select the target subscription for the current session.

   ```pwsh
   Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
   ```

2.  Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain.

   ```pwsh
   Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth
  -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
  -Name $StorageAccountName
  -DomainAccountType "ServiceLogonAccount" 
  -OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName "\<ou-name\>"
  ```

**Tip:** You have the option to not provide an OU, in which case the
object will be created in the root of the domain and can be moved
manually. You also have the option to
use **-OrganizationalUnitName** instead of the DN. If you choose to
provide just the name, the object will be created in the first OU that
matches that name.

**Tip:** You have the option to set -DomainAccountType
to **ComputerAccount** (computer object)
or **ServiceLogonAccount** (user object). Both objects will work but
watch for password change policies. In this example we are using
ServiceLogonAccount because the user object is setup automatically
with **Password never expires**.

25. Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory
    Users and Computers**.

26. Confirm that the feature is enabled.

    ```pwsh
    $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
    ```

27.  List the directory service of the selected service account
 
```pwsh
$storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
```

28. List the directory domain information if the storage account has
    enabled AD authentication for file shares

```pwsh
$storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
```

30. You can also confirm activation with your domain by navigating to
    the Azure portal, going to the storage account and
    selecting **Configuration** under **Settings**. Refer to the group
    on Active Directory (AD), as shown in the example below.

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and
assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with
an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure Share Permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level
permissions to users and/or groups:

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader:** allows read access in Azure
    Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor:** allows read, write, and
    delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor:** allows read,
    write, delete and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file
    shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an
identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary
permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying
Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access that a
particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task
demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file
share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create 4 new security groups in Active
Directory to manage share permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, open **Active Directory Users and
    Computers**.

2.  Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that
    is synchronized with Azure AD:

    -   **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

    -   **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

    -   **AZF FSLogix Reader**

    -   **WVD Users**

3.  Add an administrative account to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated
    Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file
    share permissions.

4.  Add the group **WVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix
    Contributor**.

5.  Add user accounts to the group **WVD Users**. These users will have
    access to use FSLogix profiles.

6.  Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD.

With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following
steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This
will enable to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field,
    type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the
    list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, click on the Storage account you
    created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for your storage account, locate and click on **File
    shares** .

4.  On the File shares blade, click on your file share.

5.  Click **Access Control (IAM)**.

6.  Click **+ Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

7.  On the Add role assignment fly out, fill in the following options
    and click **Save**.

    -    **Role:** Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor

    -    **Assign access to:** Azure AD user, group, or service
        principal

    -    **Select:** AZF FSLogix Contributor

8.  Repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining 2 roles.

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor \> AZF FSLogix
        Elevated Contributor

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Reader \> AZF FSLogix Reader

### Task 5: Configure NTFS Permissions for the File Share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must
assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level.
Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that
determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions
act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can
do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced
permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories
and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using
Windows File Explorer or running the Windows icacls or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser
permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your
storage account key.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field,
    type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the
    list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, click on the Storage account you
    created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**,
    select **Properties**. Locate the **Primary File Service
    Endpoint** address. This is the path you will use to access your
    file share. Reformat the path to UNC and copy it to a notepad file.
    For example:

4.  https://mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net/ ==
    \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>

5.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**,
    select **Access keys**. Copy the value for **key1** to the same
    notepad file.

6.  From a domain joined computer, open a standard command prompt and
    mount your file share using the storage account key. **Do not** use
    an elevated command prompt or the mount point will not be visible in
    File Explorer. Refer to the following examples to prepare your
    command:

7.  net use z:
    \\\\\<storage-account-name\>.file.core.windows.net\\\<share-name\>
    /user:Azure\\\<storage-account-name\> \<storage-account-key\>

Example with sample values:

net use z: \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\fslogix
/user:Azure\\mydomainazfiles
uPCvi+gP2qbCQcn3EATgbALE0H8nxhspyLRO2Nf9Hm2gMxfn/389/M33XHh7YEqNJ2GhbJXgStiifPwMBXk38Q==

**Tip:** This is an SMB connection on port 445. Most consumer ISPs block
this port by default. If you are doing this in your lab and experience
issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a
domain joined VM in Azure.

8.  Open **File Explorer**, right-click on the **X:** drive and
    select **Properties**.

9.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and
    click **Advanced**.

10. Click **Add** and add each of the AD security groups you created in
    Task 4 with the appropriate permissions.

11. Click **OK** to save your changes.

12. Disconnect the mount point.

13. net use /delete z:

### Task 6: Configure NTFS Permissions for the Containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now
create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions.
There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions
for use with Profile Containers and Office Container. Below is one
configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn\'t
require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile
types and assign the recommended permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, browse to your Azure file share using
    the account you added previously to the **AZF FSLogix Elevated
    Contributor** security group.

2.  \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>

3.  Create 3 new directories in the root share.

    -    **Profiles**

    -    **ODFC**

    -    **MSIX**

4.  Right-click on the **Profiles** directory and select **Properties**.

5.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and
    click **Advanced**.

6.  Click **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited
    permissions from this object**.

7.  Click **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**.
    Grant **Full Control** to **This folder, subfolders and files**.
    Click **OK**.

8.  Click **Add** and add **CREATOR OWNER**. Grant **Full
    Control** to **Subfolders and files only**. Click **OK**.

9.  Click **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant the following special
    permissions to **This folder only**. Click **OK**.

    -   Traverse folder / execute file

    -   List folder / read data

    -   Read attributes

    -   Create folders / append data

10. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

11. Click **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

12. Repeat steps 3-9 for the **ODFC** directory.

13. Right-click on the **MSIX** directory and select **Properties**.

14. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and
    click **Advanced**.

15. Click **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited
    permissions from this object**.

16. Click **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**.
    Grant **Full Control** to **This folder, subfolders and files**.
    Click **OK**.

17. Click **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant **Read &
    execute** to **This folder, subfolders and files**. Click **OK**.

18. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

19. Click **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

Your Azure Files Share is now ready for FSLogix profile containers. Copy
the UNC path and add it to your FSLogix deployment (image, GPO, etc..).

## Exercise 4: Create a Master Image for WVD

In this exercise we are going to walk through the process of creating a
master image for your WVD host pools. The basic concept for a master
image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on
mandatory updates, applications and configurations. There are many ways
to create and manage images for WVD. The steps covered in this exercise
are going to walk you through a basic build and capture process that
includes core applications and recommended configuration options for
WVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  On the Azure portal home page, click **Create a resource**.

3.  On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**.
    Select **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909** and
    click **Create**.

![New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan "Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909](images/windows10VM.png)

**Note:** In this exercise we are selecting a vanilla Windows 10 image
to start with, and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom
deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of
Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version
based on your requirements.

1.  On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields
    and create the VM.

**IMPORTANT:** Make a note of the **Username** and **Password** used to
create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after
creation.

**IMPORTATNT:** This guide does not walk through the process of creating
a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to
allow **RDP (3389)** , or have a bastion host deployed for remote
access.

5.  Once the VM is successfully deployed, connect using RDP. Sign in
    using the credentials you supplied when creating the VM.

### Task 2: Run Windows Update

Despite the Azure support teams best efforts, the Marketplace images are
not always up to date. The best and most secure practice is to keep your
master image up to date.

1.  From your master image VM, open the **Settings** app and
    select **Updates & Security**.

![The settings window within the Windows 10 VM](images/w10VMSettings.png)

2.  Install all missing updates, rebooting as necessary.

3.  Once the VM is fully patched, the Windows Update Settings page
    should resemble the following screenshot.

## Exercise 5: Create a Host Pool for Pooled Desktops

In this exercise we will be creating a Windows Virtual Desktop host pool
for pooled desktops. This is a set of computers or hosts which operate
on an as-needed basis. In a pooled configuration we will be hosting
multiple non-persistent sessions, with no user profile information
stored locally. This is where FSlogix Profile Containers provide the
users profile to the host dynamically. This provides the ability for an
organization to fully utilize the compute resources on a single host and
lower the total overhead, cost, and number ofremote workstations.

enabling the best experience for our customers and their users. This
guide will cover the recommended configurations using Group Policy.

To perform the tasks of configuring group policy, we will require you to
have access to your domain controller or to a Admin jump box where you
can configure domain group policies. Perform the following steps on this
system.

1.  **Download** the Group Policy Backup from this
    guide. [[WVD-GPO-Backups.zip]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/master/GPOBackups/WVD-GPO-Backups.zip) 

2.  **Extract** the contents of Zip file.

These are Group Policy Backup files from which the customer can import
the recommended configurations or set them on their own. There are HTML
files to view what was configured as well as explanation of
configuration later in this guide.

3.  Expand the extracted directories and open the **ADMX
    Templates** folder.

4.  Open a new file explorer session and navigate to
    \\\<domainname\>\\sysvol\<domainfqdn\>\\policies\\policydefinitions.

5.  Copy the **admx** files from the ADMX Templates folder to
    the **policydefinitions** folder and copy the **adml** files to
    the **policydefinitions\\en-us** subfolder. If you are asked whether
    you want to replace existing files, make you decision based on the
    date of each file. Replace older files only.

6.  Open **Group Policy Management**, this is located under Windows
    Administrative tools in the Start Menu.

7.  Expand the directories until you find Group Policy Objects

8.  Right Click Group Policy Objects and Select **New**, go ahead and
    create 6 new GPOs and name them after the 6 policies in the backup
    folder. After you are done, they should look like below.

Note: If you are helping a customer the name of the policy is not
critical just what configured. So, customers should be encouraged to use
standard naming conventions.

9.  Right click on each policy and select import Settings. Click next
    through backup GPO, on the backup locations screen select the folder
    where the back ups are located.

10. Click next through backup GPO, on the backup locations screen select
    the folder where the backups are located.

11. Select the backup that corresponds to the policy selected.

12. Click next through all the prompts until you get a succeeded message

13. Repeat this for the other 5 policies

14. Review the GPO Settings of each policy in GPMC and the summary
    below. Change the settings to organizational preferences because
    they are set to Microsoft Recommendations as-is.

15. Now link these policies to the OU where your WVD resource

Provided below is a summary of the group policy settings that Microsoft
recommends applying to Pooled desktops. Each policy is detailed with the
policy setting and reasoning. For more information, open the HTML files
in the extracted GPBackup folder you downloaded earlier.

## Exercise 11: Setup Monitoring for WVD

In this exercise we will setup monitoring for our WVD host pools. There
are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role --
troubleshooting, performance, security, etc\... There are also multiple
components that make up the WVD service, which can add some variation on
how customers implement monitoring (e.g. adding additional 3rd party
solutions). With the Spring 2020 Update we can leverage Azure Monitor
for most aspects. By the end of this exercise you will have the
following monitoring capabilities enabled:

-   Diagnostic logging for the WVD service

-   Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

-   Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

## <a name='Task1:CreateaLogAnalyticsworkspace'></a>Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each of the monitoring
capabilities covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log
data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to
consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC
controls, query performance, report development, etc\... For WVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single
dedicated workspace. If the environment in question is supporting both
Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, consider creating a dedicated workspace for
each.

In this exercise we will create a dedicated workspace for our Spring
2020 environment. If you already have a workspace created, move on to
Task 2.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type
    \"**log analytics**\". Select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the
    list.

3.  On the Log Analytics workspaces blade, click **+Add**.

4.  On the Create Log Analytics workspace blade, fill in the following
    information and click **Review + Create**.

    -    **Subscription:** Select the desired subsciption for the Log
        Analytics workspace.

    -    **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select 1
        from the list.

    -    **Name:** Enter a unique name for the workspace.

    -    **Region:** Select a region for the workspace.

5.  Click **Create**.

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the
deployment to complete. Once complete, move on to task 2.

## <a name='Task2:EnablingDiagnosticLoggingforWVD'></a>Task 2: Enabling Diagnostic Logging for WVD

Like many other Azure services, WVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring
and alerts. In order to enable diagnostic data collection, you need to
enable it for each ARM object that you want to monitor (e.g. Host pools,
Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few
hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each WVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available.
For example, host pool objects will have a different set of options then
Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data
category and their associated objects.

  **Category**        **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                              **ARM Object(s)**

## <a name='Task3:EnablingAzureMonitorfortheSessionHosts'></a>Task 3: Enabling Azure Monitor for the Session Hosts

Azure Monitor is leveraged with WVD to monitor the performance and
health of your session host VMs. This feature can be enabled for Azure
VMs in a number of ways. In this exercise we will walk through enabling
Azure Monitor on VMs using the Azure portal. Refer to the following
links for guidance on automation.

-   [Enable monitoring for a single Azure
    VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-enable-single-vm#enable-monitoring-for-a-single-azure-vm) 

-   [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs by using Azure
    Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-enable-at-scale-policy) 

-   [Enable Azure Monitor for VMs using Azure PowerShell or Resource
    Manager
    templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/vminsights-enable-at-scale-powershell) 

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type
    \"**virtual machines**\". Select **Virtual Machines** from the list.

3.  On the Virtual Machines blade, locate a session host VM and click on
    the name.

4.  On the blade for the virtual machine, under **Monitoring**,
    select **Insights**.

5.  On the Insights blade, click **Enable**. This will initiate a
    validation check.

**NOTE:** The virtual machine must be running to enable Azure Monitor.

6.  On the Insights setup page, fill in the following information and
    click **Enable**.

    -    **Workspace Subscription:** Select the desired subscription.

    -    **Choose a Log Analytics Workspace:** Select the workspace used
        in the previous task.

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the
deployment to complete. This can take 5-10 minutes. Once complete, you
will see the following items configured on the VM:

**New VM Extensions Added**\
2 new extensions are added to the VM Extensions blade in Azure.

**New Monitoring Agents Installed**\
2 new agents are installed on the VM.

**Monitoring Agent Configured for Log Analytics**\
The Microsoft Monitoring Agent is configured for your log anayltics
workspace.

At this point you should have Azure Monitor enabled on at least 1
session host VM. To enable Azure Monitor for additional session hosts,
rinse and repeat the above steps. For automation, leverage Azure Policy
or PowerShell to enable monitoring on multiple VMs.

## <a name='Task4:EnablingLogAnalyticsfortheSessionHosts'></a>Task 4: Enabling Sepago for the Session Hosts

This task currently references utilizing Sepago for the agent-based monitoring solution.  However, there is also the recommended option of utiziling the native Log Analytics agent.
https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/proactively-monitor-arm-based-windows-virtual-desktop-with-azure/ba-p/1508735 

Sepago is a Microsoft partner. They have developed an agent-based
monitoring solution for WVD, RDS, and Citrix that focuses on user
experience. The Sepago offering is available in the Azure Gallery and is
reffered to as a \"Microsoft Preferred Solution\". A Microsoft preferred
solution is a cloud application selected for its quality, performance,
and ability to address customer needs in certain areas. These solutions
are validated by a team of Microsoft experts.

The Sepago Agent monitors each session host in your WVD environment. The
agent is focused on events, performance consumption, network activities
and other metrics that determine a user's IT experiences.

### <a name='DeployingSepago'></a>Deploying Sepago

**NOTE:** Deploying the Sepago solution will require you to setup a new
Log Analytics workspace. If you already have a Log Analytics workspace
deployed for WVD monitoring, skip to the next section.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, click **+Create resource**.

3.  On the Azure Marketplace blade, type **azure monitor for rds**.
    Select **Azure Monitor for RDS and Windows Virtual Desktop** from
    the list.

4.  On the Sepago solution page, click **Create**.

5.  On the Create Azure Monitor for RDS and Windows Virtual Desktop
    page, fill in the following information and click **Review +

        Analytics workspace.

    -    **Resource group:**

    -    **Region:**

    -    **Name of the Azure Monitor workspace:**

6.  On the verification page, click **Create**.

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the
deployment to complete. This can take 2-3 minutes. Once complete, you
will have a new resource group and log analytics workspace. The custom
Sepago views have also been imported as part of this operation.

### <a name='Optional:ImportSepagoOMSViews'></a>(Optional): Import Sepago OMS Views

Follow these steps if you have an existing Log Analytics workspace and
would like to import the Sepago OMS views.

6.  Confirm the returning output shows \"**Sending test data**\",
    followed by \"**Done**\".

**NOTE:** If you receive an error, there could be a potential
communication problem. Confirm you have entered The correct Workspace Id
and Primary key values. If the connection test still fails, confirm
network connectivity with the Log Analytics workspace.

7.  Run the following command to install the Sepago Monitoring Agent.

8.  ITPC-LogAnalyticsAgent.exe -install

9.  Confirm the returning output is successful.

10. Reboot the device.

**NOTE:** If you are doing this on the session host, rinse and repeat
these steps for the entire host pool.

11. Sign in to the device where you installed the Sepago Monitoring
    Agent.

12. Open ### Task Scheduler** and confirm that **ITPC-LogAnalyticsAgent
    for RDS** appears under **Active Tasks**.

### <a name='Optional:GenerateArtificialEvents'></a>(Optional): Generate Artificial Events

In a lab environment it may be necessary to generate artificial activity
on the session host. One way to generate monitoring events is to put a
simulated load on the CPU.

To create a simulated load, you can perform the following:

-   RDP into a session host as one of your WVD test users

-   Download ListDLLs from Sysinternals

-   Use PowerShell to repeatedly run ListDLLs

Sample PowerShell (replace proper path below):

```pwsh
\$intCounter = 1

while (\$intCounter -lt 100) {

start-process
\"C:\\users\\\<useraccount\>\\Downloads\\ListDlls\\ListDlls.exe\"

start-sleep 10

\$intCounter++

}
```

You may need to run ListDlls.exe once and accept the EULA before running
the script above.

Let the script execute for several minutes. Wait some more time for the
metrics to be reported into the Log Analytics workspace.

Navigate to the Log Analytics workspace.

Performance counters and performance metrics are captured in
ITPC\_CTX\_PerfData\_CL. To display a table of performance data results,
use the following Kusto Query:

```
ITPC\_CTX\_PerfData\_CL

\| where TimeGenerated \> ago(1h)

\| where Category == \"Processor Information\"
```

The results will include a table similar to the one shown below. You
will see that one of your Session Hosts has a significant amount of CPU
utilization (running ListDlls) while the others do not.

If you change the view to a timechart you can see the utilization over a
time period (for instance, as shown below, a 24 hour period). We can see
the two most active processes are the ListDLL64.exe and MsMpEng.exe
(Defender AV scanning). Use the following Kusto query to generate a
timechart:

```
ITPC\_CTX\_Process\_CL

\| summarize avg(PercentProcessorTime\_d) by Name\_s, TimeGenerated

\| where Name\_s != \"System Idle Process\"

\| order by avg\_PercentProcessorTime\_d desc

\| take 20

\| render timechart
```
Set the time range to 24 hours.

By setting the time range to **last hour** you can get a \"zoom in\" on
the last hour of performance.

We can look at individual process time with the following query:

```Kusto
ITPC\_CTX\_Process\_CL

\| where TimeGenerated \> ago(1h)

\| where Name\_s != \"System Idle Process\"

\| order by PercentProcessorTime\_d desc

\| take 20

\| render timechart
```
A common ask is to identify the different VM sizes being used in your
host pools. In the lab environment, this will be a single-color pie
chart because you generally use a single VM size.

```Kusto
ITPC\_CTX\_Worker\_CL

\| summarize count() by VmSize\_s

\| render piechart
```

The following Kusto query will indicate the session information for
active sessions:

```Kusto
ITPC\_CTX\_Session\_CL

\| where TimeGenerated \> ago(1h)

\| project ConnectTime\_t, LoginTime\_t, UserName\_s,
ConnectionState\_s, Worker\_s, DesktopGroup\_s
```

## <a name='ExampleKustoQueries'></a>Example Kusto Queries

For a list of example queries, refer to the following Docs article:

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example
queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 

**Troubleshooting**

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. The example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Windows Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of WVD there may be challenges with either
having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.

#### <a name='Domaintroubleshooting'></a>Domain troubleshooting

1.  Verify that the AD account has the correct permissions for domain
    joining machines based on the [blog domain join
    blog. ](https://www.prajwaldesai.com/allow-domain-user-to-add-computer-to-domain/)

When deploying WVD machines to the OU path below. This is the OU where
the AD account AdAdmin has create and delete rights for machine objects.
I've validated that he can manually create and delete AD objects in this
OU.

MachineAccountOU: OU=AZWVD,DC=DS,DC=CUSTOMERDOMAIN,DC=COM

Verify using PowerShell that the AD account can create AD object in the
OU

C:\\PS\>New-ADComputer -Name \"\'WVDPOC4-0\'\" -SamAccountName
\"\'WVDPOC4-0\'\" -Path \"

OU=AZWVD,DC=DS,DC=CUSTOMERDOMAIN,DC=COM \"

**Resolution: Try the following steps to resolve domain join issues.**

When using an ARM template you man encounter domain join errors. Use the
following tips to verify what information is being displayed.

Step 1) Verify the AD permissions for the domain account. In some
enterprises the account being used to join the domain is not a domain
admin and only has limited rights to a specific OU for create and delete
of objects.

Step 2) If you receive a domain join failure ensure that credentials are
correct.

Step 3) Attempt to provision a new windows machine with just the Azure
portal and manually domain join the machine in the exact OU that the
admin states he/she has permissions to.

i\. Also if there may be enforced permissions to the OU you can try
other Ous.

Step4) Attempt to use another elevated account from an IT person that
has rights with other Ous.

Step5) If there is a failure for the domain join, RDP into the WVD
machine that is created with the local account created that mirrors the
domain account entered in the field. Open event viewer and in

Generally error 5 means lack of permission. Which is what is implied
from your comment that he has access only to a specific OU.

Please review the following guide
- [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t ](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2F4341920%2Ftroubleshoot-errors-that-occur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t&data=02%7C01%7CTony.Sanchez%40microsoft.com%7C9a12f152a1a04a424dd208d71585033d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637001533351343241&sdata=ID58ohzrEMhdaOri5KgcnC9Ixk3mDW36qeAW6vEPpSc%3D&reserved=0)

Step 6) Grab additional logs from the path

Windows clients log the details of domain join operations in the
%windir%\\debug\\Netsetup.log file.

C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\scriptlogs.log

**C:WindowsdebugNetSetup.log**

Step 7) also can you try this and provide the output?

To troubleshoot the issue, run a similar command from the command prompt
to confirm the above analysis.

net use \[\\\\dcname\\ipc\$\](file://dcname/ipc\$) /u:\< domain\\user \>
\< password \>

try the command above with a output that should say something like
below:

Step 8) Verify that the password used for the account does not have a
non-standard character that could cause issues.

Characters like "/" and others can cause automation to
fail.

Agent Installation and Update process:

-   Initial Version of the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is downloaded
    and installed from an externally accessible download location
    (either [manually](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell#register-the-virtual-machines-to-the-windows-virtual-desktop-preview-host-pool)  or
    via Azure Marketplace)

-   Once the Initial version of Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is
    installed, it queries the WVD service to determine the desired
    version of the WVD agent, Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure
    Geneva Agent and SXS stack

-   Desired version of the Agent, Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure
    Geneva Agent and SXS stack (in the same order) are then pulled from
    an Azure blob location and installed on the Virtual Machine.

-   This upgrade operation normally lasts about few minutes

-   There may be few scenarios where upgrade of the WVD agent may fail.
    When this scenario occurs output of the Get-RDSSessionnHost
    -TenantName \<tenantname\> -HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\> will be
    like below:

When this issue occurs, follow below steps to troubleshoot:

1.  Review WVD Agent installation C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft
    RDInfra\\AgentInstall.txt to see if the installation failed

2.  Review version of WVD Agent already installed on your VM.

 ? Go to Control Panel\\Programs\\Programs and Features. Look for latest
version of "Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent" installed on
the Virtual Machine and note the same.

1.  Review if there is a later version of this agent downloaded onto the
    Virtual machine. Go to C:\\program files\\Microsoft RdInfra and look
    for versions later than one installed.

a\. The Agentinstall.txt log files has data regarding the agent
installation. It may be helpful to open that log and verify that there
are no errors that may related permissions used to install the agent.

-   In case there is a newer version:

    -   Attempt to manually install the MSI. Note this requires you to
        acquire and supply a new registration token. o Run the below
        cmdlet to create a registration token to authorize a session
        host to join the host pool and save it to a new file on your
        local computer. You can specify how long the registration token
        is valid by using the -ExpirationHours parameter.

    -   New-RdsRegistrationInfo -TenantName \<tenantname\> -HostPoolName
        \<hostpoolname\> -

ExpirationHours \<number of hours\> \| Select-Object -ExpandProperty
Token \> \<PathToRegFile\>

-   In case there is no newer version:

o Uninstall all the versions of the agents from Control
Panel\\Programs\\Programs and Features o Remove the session host from
the host pool also before reinstalling the agent. Leaving the session
host in the host pool can result in errors like the event ID 2277

Manually install Windows Virtual Desktop agent and register it using the
steps
described [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell) 

1.  Once the agent is manually installed, you should see the
    Get-RDSSessionHost -TenantName \<tenantname\> HostPoolName
    \<hostpoolname\> output as below:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  In case the manual installation fails, review

-   Contents of "UpdateErrorMessage" in Get-RDSSessionHost -TenantName
    \<tenantname\> -

HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\>

-   Application Event logs in Event Viewer:

When connecting to a Host Pool you may come across an error such as:

### <a name='Possiblereasons'></a>Possible reasons

This problem can occur for multiple reasons:

-   if the VM running the host pool is shut off

-   If the VM running the host pool is deleted

-   The Host pool configuration is deprecated

### <a name='Solution'></a>Solution

Please first check if the VM is actually available and running in the
Azure Portal. If that is the case, run:

```pwsh
Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl \"https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com\"

\$tenant = Get-RdsTenant; \$tenant

\$tenantName = \$tenant.TenantName

\$hostpoolname = \"wvd-hostpool1\"

\$hostPoolLevelInput = @{

TenantName = \$tenantName

HostPoolName = \$hostpoolname

}
\$sessionHost = Get-RdsSessionHost \@hostPoolLevelInput; \$sessionHost
```
to check if the VM has any Heartbeat. The result may look like

```

If a VM is removed without removing the host pool configuration on the
tenant, it will appear with a \'No heartbeat\' status. If thats the
case, run:

```pwsh

to subsequently remove the VM from the tenant. Currently the only way
the re-register the machine is to redeploy it.

07/29/2019 20:51:47:212 Resolution: Try the following steps to resolve
domain join issues.

When using an ARM template you man encounter domain join errors. Use the
following tips to verify what information is being displayed.

Step 1) Verify the AD permissions for the domain account. In some
enterprises the account being used to join the domain is not a domain
admin and only has limited rights to a specific OU for create and delete
of objects.

Step 2) If you receive a domain join failure ensure that credentials are
correct.

Step 3) Attempt to provision a new windows machine with just the Azure
portal and manually domain join the machine in the exact OU that the
admin states he/she has permissions to.

i\. Also if there may be enforced permissions to the OU you can try
other Ous.

Step4) Attempt to use another elevated account from an IT person that
has rights with other Ous.

Step5) If there is a failure for the domain join, RDP into the WVD
machine that is created with the local account created that mirrors the
domain account entered in the field. Open event viewer and in

Generally error 5 means lack of permission. Which is what is implied
from your comment that he has access only to a specific OU.

Please review the following guide
- [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t]](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t) 

Step 6) Grab additional logs from the path

Windows clients log the details of domain join operations in the
%windir%\\debug\\Netsetup.log file.

C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\scriptlogs.log

C:WindowsdebugNetSetup.log

Step 7) also can you try this and provide the output?

To troubleshoot the issue, run a similar command from the command prompt
to confirm the above analysis.

net use \[\\dcname\\ipc\](file://dcname/ipc\](*file*://*dcname*/*ipc*)
/u:\< domain\\user \> \< password \>

try the command above with a output that should say something like
below:

Step 8) Verify that the password used for the account does not have a
non-standard character that could cause issues.

Characters like "/" and others can cause automation to
fail.
