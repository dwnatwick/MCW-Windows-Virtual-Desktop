# Implementing Windows Virtual Desktop for the enterprise hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a Windows Virtual Desktop Infrastructure and learn how-to setup a working WVD environment end-to-end in a typical Enterprise model. At the end of the lab, attendees will have deployed an Azure Active Directory Tenant with Azure AD Connect to an Active Directory Domain Controller that is running in Azure. You will also deploy the Azure infrastructure for the Windows Virtual Desktop Tenant(s), Host Pool(s) and session host(s), and connect to a WVD session utilizing different supported devices and browsers. You will publish Windows Virtual Desktops and remote apps, and configure user profiles and file shares with FSLogix.  Finally, you will configure monitoring and security for the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure and understand the steps to manage the master images.

## Overview

In this lab, attendees will deploy the [Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-desktop/) solution. Exclusively available as an Azure cloud service, Windows Virtual Desktop allows you to choose a flexible end user virtualized application or desktop delivery model that best aligns with your enterprise Azure cloud strategy. WVD simplifies the IT model to virtualize and deploy modern and legacy desktop app experiences with unified management---without needing to host, install, configure and manage components such as diagnostics, networking, connection brokering, and gateway. WVD brings together Microsoft Office 365 and Azure to provide users with the only multi-session Windows 10 experience with exceptional scale and reduced IT costs while empowering today's modern digital workspace.

## Before the hands-on lab

-   Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide before continuing to the lab exercises.
  
-   Make sure to keep track of what user accounts you are using and where you are using them.

-   Regions and locations, make sure to stay consistent as much as possible.


## Solution architecture

![Solution architecture](images/wvdsolutiondiagramv2.png "Solution architecture") This diagram shows a Windows Virtual Desktop architecture with on-premises servers for Active Directory.  In the diagram, the host pools are providing the WVD session to the different supported devices. Azure Monitor, Network Watcher, and Log Analytics are monitoring and logging activity and performance metrics.


## Exercise 1: Configuring Azure AD Connect with AD DS

In this exercise you will be configuring [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect). With Windows Virtual Desktop, all session host VMs within the WVD tenant environment are required to be domain joined to AD DS, and the domain must be synchronized with Azure AD. To manage the synchronization of objects, you will configure Azure AD Connect on the domain controller deployed in Azure.

>**Note**: RDP access to a domain controller using a public IP address is not a best practice and is only done to simplify this lab. Better security practices such as removing the PIP, enabling just-in-time access and/or leveraging a bastion host should be applied enhance security.


### Task 1: Connecting to the domain controller

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  Type **Resource groups** in the search field and select it from the list.

3.  On the Resource groups blade, Select on the **Infra** resource group.

4.  On the Infra Resource group blade, review the list of available resources. Locate the resource named **AdPubIP1** and Select on it. Note that the resource type should be **Public IP address**.

5.  On the Overview page for AdPubIP1, locate the **IP address** field. Copy the IP address to a safe location.

6.  On your local machine, open the **RUN** dialog window, type **MSTSC** and hit enter.

    ![Run on Windows](images/run.png "Run on Windows") 

7.  In the **Remote Desktop Connection** window, paste in the public IP address from the previous step. Select **Connect**.

    ![Window for Remote Desktop Connection](images/remoteDesktop.png "Window for Remote Desktop Connection") 

8.  When prompted, sign in with the AD domain UPN credentials. For example, if you used the ARM template from [Before HOL setup guide](), the credentials will be something along the lines of: [adadmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:adadmin@MyADDomain.com) with the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. If prompted, Select **Yes** to accept the RDP certification warning.

    >**Note**: This is the Active Directory account from the ARM template, not the Azure AD Global Admin account. If you have trouble signing in, try typing the credentials in manually, as copy and paste may include an unnecessary space, which will cause authentication to fail.

### Task 2: Disabling IE Enhanced Security

In an effort to simplify tasks in this lab, we will start by disabling [IE Enhanced Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-esc).

1.  Once connected to the domain controller, open Server Manager if it does not start automatically.

2.  In Server Manager, select **Local Server** on the left.

3.  Locate the **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** option and Select **On**.

    ![Local Server properties within server manager](images/IEESC.png "Local Server properties within server manager") 

4.  On the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration window, under **Administrators**, select the **Off** radio button and Select **OK**.

### Task 3: Creating a Domain Admin account

By default, Azure AD Connect does not synchronize the built-in domain administrator account [ADAdmin\@MyADDomain.com](mailto:ADAdmin@MyADDomain.com). This system account has the attribute isCriticalSystemObject set to *true*, preventing it from being synchronized. While it is possible to modify this, it is not a best practice to do so.

1.  In Server Manager, Select **Tools** in the upper right corner and select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

    ![Server Manager Tools](images/serverMangerTools.png "Server Manager Tools") 

2.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-Select the **Users** organization unit and select **New \> User** from the menu.

    ![Folder path for new user](images/newUser.png "Folder path for new user") 

3.  Complete the New User wizard.

    ![New User Wizard window](images/newUserWizard.png "New User Wizard window") 

    >**Note**: This account will be important in future tasks. Make a note of the username and password you create. When setting the password, uncheck the box **User must change password at next logon**.

4.  In Active Directory Users and Computers, right-Select on the new user account object and select **Add to a group**.

5.  On the Select Groups dialog window, type **Domain Admins** and Select **OK**.

    >**Note**: This account will be used during the host pool creation process for joining the hosts to the domain. Granting Domain Admin permissions will simplify the lab.However, any Active Directory account that has the following permissions will suffice. This can be done using [Active Directory Delegate Control](https://danielengberg.com/domain-join-permissions-delegate-active-directory/). 

-   Create computer objects

-   Delete computer object

### Task 4: Configuring Azure AD Connect

1.  On the desktop of the domain controller, locate the icon for **Azure AD Connect** and double-Select on it.

2.  Accept the license terms and privacy notice, then select continue. On the next screen select **Use express settings**. The required components will install.

    ![Azure AD connect set up screen](images/AzureADconnectExpressSetting.png "Azure AD connect set up screen") 

3.  On the Connect to Azure AD page, enter in the Azure AD Global Admin credentials. For example: [azadmin\@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:azadmin@MyAADdomain.onmicrosoft.com) and the correct password. Select **Next**.

    >**Note**: This is the account associated with your Azure subscription.

4.  On the Connect to AD DS page, enter in the Active Directory credentials for a Domain Admin account. For example, if you used the ARM template deployment for the domain controller, the credentials will be something along the lines of: **[[MyADDomain.com]](http://myaddomain.com/) \\ADadmin** with the password: **WVD\@zureL\@b2019!**. Select **Next**

    >**Note**: If you copy and paste the password, please ensure that there are no trailing spaces, as that will cause the verification to fail.

5.  Select **Install** to start the configuration and synchronization.

6.  After a few minutes the Azure AD Connect installation will complete.
    Select **Exit**.

    ![The Configuration is completed window](images/AADCcomplete.png "The Configuration is completed window")
7.  Minimize the RDP session for the domain controller and wait a few minutes for the AD accounts to be synchronized to Azure AD.

8.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

9.  Type **Azure Active Directory** in the search field and select it from the list.

10. On the Azure Active Directory blade, under **Manage**, select **Users**.

11. Review the list of user account objects and confirm the test accounts have synchronized, as shown below.

    >**Note**: It can take up to 15 minutes for the Active Directory objects to be synchronized to the Azure AD tenant.

**What\'s New in the Spring 2020 Update?**

On April 30th, the Spring update for Windows Virtual Desktop entered public preview. This gives everyone the opportunity to start playing with the new features and capabilities. There are number of significant enhancements that customers are going to be eager to get their hands on.

Tom Hickling and Christiaan Brinkhoff have both published excellent writeups on the Spring update, including a breakdown on the core changes and new features. For more information we encourage you to check out their blog posts:

-   [[Windows Virtual Desktop Spring Update enters Public Preview]](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245)

-   [[Windows Virtual Desktop technical (2020 spring update -- ARM-based model public preview) deployment walkthrough. It covers all you need to know and
    beyond!]](https://www.christiaanbrinkhoff.com/2020/05/01/windows-virtual-desktop-technical-2020-spring-update-arm-based-model-deployment-walkthrough/#NewAzurePortal-Dashboard) 

## Exercise 2: Create Azure AD Groups for WVD

In this exercise you will be working with groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to assist in managing access assignment to your application groups in WVD. The new ARM portal for WVD supports access assignment using Azure AD groups. This capability greatly simplifies access management. Groups will also be leveraged in this guide to manage
share permissions in Azure Files for FSLogix.

You will be creating 3 Azure AD groups to manage access to the different application groups -- Personal, Pooled, and RemoteApp. For this guide we will only create a single group for RemoteApps, but in a production scenario it is more common to use separate groups based on the app or persona defined by the customer. Be sure to make note of the groups you create, as they will be used in later exercises.

It is also important to keep in mind that these groups can also originate from the Windows Active Directory environment and synchronize via Azure AD Connect. This will be another common scenario for customers that already have processes defined on-prem for group management.

### Task 1: Creating Azure AD Groups

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left and select **+ New group**.

4.  On the New Group page, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Pooled Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![New Group window](images/newGroup2.png "New Group window")

5.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Remote App All Users

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![New Group window](images/newGroup1.png) "New Group window"

6.  Select **+ New group** again, fill in the following options and Select **Create**.

    -    **Group type:** Security

    -    **Group name:** WVD Persistent Desktop User

    -    **Membership type:** Assigned

    ![](images/newGroup3.png "New Group Window")

### Task 2: Assign Users to Groups

Now that the Azure AD groups are in place, we will assign users for testing. Once the groups are populated, we can leverage them for assigning access to WVD resources once they are created.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **Azure Active Directory**. Select **Azure Active Directory** from the list.

3.  On the Azure Active Directory page, select **Groups** on the left and select the desired group.

4.  Select **Members** and **+ Add Members**

![Azure AD blade](images/newMember.png)

5.  In the search field, enter the name of a User to add Select **Select** to add them to the group.

6.  Repeat steps 4-6 for the other 2 groups.

At this point you have 3 new Azure AD groups with members assigned. Make a note of the group names and accounts you added for use later in this guide. These groups will be used to assign access to WVD application groups.

## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

There are multiple solutions available for storing FSLogix profiles containers.

-   Windows File Server - [Create a profile container for a host pool using a file share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-user-profile) 

-   NetApp Files - [Create an FSLogix profile container for a host pool using Azure NetApp Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-FSLogix-profile-container) 

-   Azure Files - [Create an FSLogix profile container with Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-profile-container-adds) 

In this exercise you will be creating an Azure Files share and enabling SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for WVD users. At the end of this exercise you will have the following components:

-   A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

-   A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

-   AD authentication enabled for your Azure storage account.

-   Permissions applied for user access to the file share.



### Task 1: Create a Storage Account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

3.  On the Storage Accounts window that appears, Select **+ Add**.

4.  Fill in the required parameters for the storage account. Refer to the following example for more information on the available parameters. Make a note that contains the values you provide for **Resource group** and **Storage account name**. These will be needed later in the exercise.

    ![](images/storacc.png)

5.  Select **Review + Create** to review your storage account settings and create the account.

6.  Select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share

1.  At the top of the Azure Portal page, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts**. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the Overview page for your Storage account, select **File shares**.

4.  On the File shares blade, Select **+ File Share**.

5.  Enter a Name the new file share and Select **Create**.

    >**Note**: The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD Authentication for your Storage Account

**Prerequisites**

1.  The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain joined computer. The AzFilesHybrid module use the AD PowerShell module, so running from a server is preferred.

2.  PowerShell version 5.0+ installed.

3.  The account used in this task needs to meet the following requirements:

    -    Synchronized with Azure AD.

    -    Permissions to create user or computer objects in Active Directory.

    -    Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task we will be completing the steps on the Domain Controller in Azure using an account that has been assigned Global Administrator and Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this back as long as you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1.  From a domain joined computer, download and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases) .

2.  Open an elevated PowerShell ISE window.

3.  Configure the PowerShell execution policy **Unrestricted** for the current user.

    ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

4.  Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid. For example:

    ```
    cd C:\\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

6.  Install the AzFilesHybrid module.

    ```
    .\\CopyToPSPath.ps1
    ```

8.  Import the AzFilesHybrid module

    ```  
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

10. Sign in with an account that meets the prerequisites.

    ```
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

12. Create the following PowerShell variables.
    

    ```
    $SubscriptionId = "\<subscription-id\>\"
    $ResourceGroupName = "\<resource-group-name\>\"
    $StorageAccountName = "\<storage-account-name\>\"
    ```

    >**Note**: The Resource Group Name and Storage Account Name were assigned in Task 1.

    >**Note**: You can run **Get-AzSubscription** to lookup the available subscription names.


13.  Select the target subscription for the current session.
  

        ```
        Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
        ```

10. Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain.

    ```
    Join-AzStorageAccountForAuth
    -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
    -Name $StorageAccountName
    -DomainAccountType "ServiceLogonAccount" 
    -OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName "\<ou-name\>"
    ```

    >**Note**: You have the option to not provide an OU, in which case the object will be created in the root of the domain and can be moved manually. You also have the option to use **-OrganizationalUnitName** instead of the DN. If you choose to provide just the name, the object will be created in the first OU that matches that name.

    >**Note**: You have the option to set -DomainAccountType to **ComputerAccount** (computer object)
    or **ServiceLogonAccount** (user object). Both objects will work but watch for password change policies. In this example we are using ServiceLogonAccount because the user object is setup automatically with **Password never expires**.

1.  Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  Confirm that the feature is enabled.

        ```
        $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
        ```

3.   List the directory service of the selected service account
 
        ```
        $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
        ```

1.  List the directory domain information if the storage account has enabled AD authentication for file shares

    ```
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
    ```

30. You can also confirm activation with your domain by navigating to the Azure portal, going to the storage account and selecting **Configuration** under **Settings**. Refer to the group on Active Directory (AD), as shown in the example below.

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure Share Permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level permissions to users and/or groups:

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader:** allows read access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor:** allows read, write, and delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor:** allows read, write, delete and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access that a particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create 4 new security groups in Active Directory to manage share permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

2.  Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that is synchronized with Azure AD:

    -   **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

    -   **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

    -   **AZF FSLogix Reader**

    -   **WVD Users**

3.  Add an administrative account to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file share permissions.

4.  Add the group **WVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix Contributor**.

5.  Add user accounts to the group **WVD Users**. These users will have access to use FSLogix profiles.

6.  Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD.

With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This will enable to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the Storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for your storage account, locate and Select on **File shares** .

4.  On the File shares blade, Select on your file share.

5.  Select **Access Control (IAM)**.

6.  Select **+ Add** and select **Add role assignment**.

7.  On the Add role assignment fly out, fill in the following options and Select **Save**.

    -    **Role:** Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor

    -    **Assign access to:** Azure AD user, group, or service principal

    -    **Select:** AZF FSLogix Contributor

8.  Repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining 2 roles.

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor \> AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor

    -    Storage File Data SMB Share Reader \> AZF FSLogix Reader

### Task 5: Configure NTFS Permissions for the File Share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that
determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows icacls or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your storage account key.

1.  In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources** field, type **storage accounts** and select **Storage accounts** from the list.

2.  On the Storage accounts blade, Select on the Storage account you created in Task 1.

3.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**, select **Properties**. Locate the **Primary File Service Endpoint** address. This is the path you will use to access your file share. Reformat the path to UNC and copy it to a notepad file. For example:

    https://mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net/ ==
    \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>

5.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. Copy the value for **key1** to the same notepad file.

6.  From a domain joined computer, open a standard command prompt and mount your file share using the storage account key. **Do not** use an elevated command prompt or the mount point will not be visible in File Explorer. Refer to the following examples to prepare your command:

7.  net use z:\\\\\<storage-account-name\>.file.core.windows.net\\\<share-name\>/user:Azure\\\<storage-account-name\> \<storage-account-key\>

    Example with sample values:
    net use z: \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\FSLogix/user:Azure\\mydomainazfilesuPCvi+gP2qbCQcn3EATgbALE0H8nxhspyLRO2Nf9Hm2gMxfn/389/M33XHh7YEqNJ2GhbJXgStiifPwMBXk38Q==

    >**Note**: This is an SMB connection on port 445. Most consumer ISPs block this port by default. If you are doing this in your lab and experience issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a domain joined VM in Azure.

8.  Open **File Explorer**, right-Select on the **X:** drive and select **Properties**.

9.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

10. Select **Add** and add each of the AD security groups you created in Task 4 with the appropriate permissions.

11. Select **OK** to save your changes.

12. Disconnect the mount point.

13. net use /delete z:

### Task 6: Configure NTFS Permissions for the Containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions. There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions for use with Profile Containers and Office Container. Below is one configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn't require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile types and assign the recommended permissions.

1.  From a domain joined computer, browse to your Azure file share using the account you added previously to the **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** security group.

    ```
    \\\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>
    ```

3.  Create 3 new directories in the root share.

    -    **Profiles**

    -    **ODFC**

    -    **MSIX**

4.  Right-Select on the **Profiles** directory and select **Properties**.

5.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

6.  Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

7.  Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** to **This folder, subfolders and files**. Select **OK**.

8.  Select **Add** and add **Creator owner**. Grant **Full Control** to **Subfolders and files only**. Select **OK**.

9.  Select **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant the following special permissions to **This folder only**. Select **OK**.

    -   Traverse folder / execute file

    -   List folder / read data

    -   Read attributes

    -   Create folders / append data

10. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

11. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

12. Repeat steps 3-9 for the **ODFC** directory.

13. Right-Select on the **MSIX** directory and select **Properties**.

14. On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and Select **Advanced**.

15. Select **Disable inheritance** and select **Remove all inherited permissions from this object**.

16. Select **Add** and add **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. Grant **Full Control** to **This folder, subfolders and files**. Select **OK**.

17. Select **Add** and add **WVD Users**. Grant **Read & execute** to **This folder, subfolders and files**. Select **OK**.

18. Confirm your permissions match the screenshots below.

19. Select **OK** on both property windows to apply your changes.

Your Azure Files Share is now ready for FSLogix profile containers. Copy the UNC path and add it to your FSLogix deployment (image, GPO, etc..).

## Exercise 4: Create a Master Image for WVD

In this exercise we are going to walk through the process of creating a master image for your WVD host pools. The basic concept for a master image is to start with a clean base install of Windows and layer on mandatory updates, applications and configurations. There are many ways to create and manage images for WVD. The steps covered in this exercise are going to walk you through a basic build and capture process that includes core applications and recommended configuration options for WVD.

### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  On the Azure portal home page, Select **Create a resource**.

3.  On the New page, search for **Microsoft Windows 10**. Select **Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909** and Select **Create**.

    ![New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909](images/windows10VM.png "New Microsoft Windows 10 VM using software plan Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, Version 1909")

    >**Note**: In this exercise we are selecting a vanilla Windows 10 image to start with, and installing Office 365 ProPlus using a custom deployment script. We are also using the latest available release of Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, but you can choose the version based on your requirements.

1.  On the Create a virtual machine page, fill in the required fields and create the VM.

    >**Note**: Make a note of the **Username** and **Password** used to create the VM. This information will be required to access the VM after creation.

    >**Note**: This guide does not walk through the process of creating a VM in Azure. However, for **Inbound port rules**, be sure to allow **RDP (3389)** , or have a bastion host deployed for remote access.

### Task 3: Prepare WVD Image

**Introduction to the script**

The authors for this content have developed a scripted solution to assist in automating some common baseline image build tasks. The script includes a UI form, enabling you to quickly select which actions to perform. The end result will be a custom master image that incorporates Microsoft's main business applications, along with the necessary
policies and settings for an optimized user experience.

The script and related tools are maintained in GitHub - [Download Link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/tree/master/Image-Build/Customizations) 

For additional documentation about the script (e.g. parameters, functions, etc.), refer to the comments in **Prepare-WVDImage.ps1**.

For troubleshooting script execution, refer to the following log directory on the target machine: **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep**.

This script leverages the [Local Group Policy Object (LGPO)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10#what-is-the-local-group-policy-object-lgpo-tool) tool in the [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-compliance-toolkit-10) to apply settings in the image. The settings are documented and exported on the target machine under **C:\\Windows\\Logs\\ImagePrep\\LGPO**. This approach was taken to simplify troubleshooting, enabling you to leverage Group Policy Results.

3.  Navigate to: **C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep**.

    ```
    cd C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep
    ```

4.  Run the following command to sysprep the VM and shutdown:

    ```
    sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /shutdown
    ``` 

The system will automatically shutdown and disconnect your RDP session.

### Task 5: Create a managed image from the Master Image VM

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type **virtual machines**. Select **Virtual machines** from the list.

3.  On the Virtual machines blade, locate the VM you used for your master image and **Select** on the name.

4.  On the Overview blade for your VM, confirm the **Status** shows **Stopped**. Select **Stop** in the menu bar to move it to a deallocated state.

5.  Once complete, Select **Capture** in the menu bar..

6.  On the Create image blade, fill in the required fields and Select **Create**.

    ![Create Image blade in Azure](images/w10VMImage.png "Create Image blade in Azure")

7.  Once complete, type **images** in the **Search resources field** at the top of the page. Select **Images** from the list.

8.  On the Images blade, locate your image and **Select** on the name.

9.  On the Overview blade for your image, make note of the **Name** field and **Resource group** field. These attributes are needed when you provision your host pools.

### Task 6: Provision a Host Pool with a custom image

1.  To start provisioning a host pool with your custom image, follow the instructions in [Exercise 5](#exercise-5-create-a-host-pool-for-pooled-desktops).

2.  When you get to the step to configure **Virtual machine settings**, select the option for **Managed Image** and fill in the required fields.


## Exercise 5: Create a Host Pool for pooled desktops

In this exercise we will be creating a Windows Virtual Desktop host pool for pooled desktops. This is a set of computers or hosts which operate on an as-needed basis. In a pooled configuration we will be hosting multiple non-persistent sessions, with no user profile information stored locally. This is where FSLogix Profile Containers provide the users profile to the host dynamically. This provides the ability for an organization to fully utilize the compute resources on a single host and lower the total overhead, cost, and number of remote workstations.

5.  Under Manage, select **Assignments** and Select **+ Add**.

6.  In the fly out, enter the name of your Azure AD group. In this exercise we will select **WVD Pooled Desktop Users**.

7.  Select **Select** to save your changes.

With the assignment added, you can move on to the next exercise. The users in the Azure AD group can be used to validate access to the new host pool in a later exercise.

## Exercise 6: Create a Host Pool for Pooled RemoteApps

In this exercise we will be creating a non-persistent host pool for publishing RemoteApps. This enables you to assign users access to specific applications rather than an entire desktop. This type of application deployment serves many purposes and is not new to WVD, but has existed in Windows Server Remote Desktop Services for many years.

### Task 1: Connecting with the HTML5 Web Client

1.  Open a supported web browser.

2.  Navigate to the [Spring 2020 portal](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html) .

    >**Note**: During the public preview, the URL for the Spring 2020 portal is different then the Fall 2019 portal. 
    **Fall 2019**: <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient/index.html> 
    **Spring 2020**: <https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/index.html> 

3.  Sign in using a synchronized identity that has been assigned to an application group.

4.  Select an available resource from the web client. In this example we will connect to a host pool containing pooled desktop.

5.  On the **Access local resources** prompt, review the available options for and Select **Allow**.

6.  On the **Enter your credentials** prompt, sign in using the same account from Step 3 and Select **Submit**.

7.  Once connected, validate the components relative to your configuration:

    -    **FSLogix Profile Container**

             -   Did the profile direct get created on the file share?

             -   Is the profile appearing in Disk Management?

             -   Do your profile settings persist when connecting to different hosts?

    -    **Business Applications**

## Exercise 10: Configure Session Hosts with Group Policy

After working with the Windows 10 Marketplace builds, we found some areas that needed improvement. Our goal is to ensure that we are enabling the best experience for our customers and their users. This guide will cover the recommended configurations using Group Policy.

To perform the tasks of configuring group policy, we will require you to have access to your domain controller or to a Admin jump box where you can configure domain group policies. Perform the following steps on this system.

### Task 1: Create a Group Policy backup

1.  **Download** the Group Policy Backup from this guide. [[WVD-GPO-Backups.zip]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawntmeyer/WVD/master/GPOBackups/WVD-GPO-Backups.zip) 

2.  **Extract** the contents of Zip file.

These are Group Policy Backup files from which the customer can import the recommended configurations or set them on their own. There are HTML files to view what was configured as well as explanation of configuration later in this guide.

3.  Expand the extracted directories and open the **ADMX Templates** folder.

4.  Open a new file explorer session and navigate to:
   
 
    ``  \\\<domainname\>\\sysvol\<domainfqdn\>\\policies\\policydefinitions
    ``

5.  Copy the **admx** files from the ADMX Templates folder to the **policydefinitions** folder and copy the **adml** files to the **policydefinitions\\en-us** subfolder. If you are asked whether you want to replace existing files, make you decision based on the date of each file. Replace older files only.

6.  Open **Group Policy Management**, this is located under Windows Administrative tools in the Start Menu.

7.  Expand the directories until you find Group Policy Objects

8.  Right Select Group Policy Objects and Select **New**, go ahead and create 6 new GPOs and name them after the 6 policies in the backup folder. After you are done, they should look like below.

    >**Note**: If you are helping a customer the name of the policy is not critical just what configured. So, customers should be encouraged to use
standard naming conventions.

9.  Right Select on each policy and select import Settings. Select next through backup GPO, on the backup locations screen select the folder where the back ups are located.

10. Select next through backup GPO, on the backup locations screen select the folder where the backups are located.

11. Select the backup that corresponds to the policy selected.

12. Select next through all the prompts until you get a succeeded message

13. Repeat this for the other 5 policies

14. Review the GPO Settings of each policy in GPMC and the summary below. Change the settings to organizational preferences because they are set to Microsoft Recommendations as-is.

15. Now link these policies to the OU where your WVD resource


### Task 2: Configure the Group Policy settings 

Provided below is a summary of the group policy settings that Microsoft recommends applying to Pooled desktops. Each policy is detailed with the policy setting and reasoning. For more information, open the HTML files in the extracted GPBackup folder you downloaded earlier.

## Exercise 11: Setup Monitoring for WVD

In this exercise we will setup monitoring for our WVD host pools. There are multiple reasons why monitoring serves a critical role -- troubleshooting, performance, security, etc\... There are also multiple components that make up the WVD service, which can add some variation on how customers implement monitoring (e.g. adding additional 3rd party solutions). With the Spring 2020 Update we can leverage Azure Monitor for most aspects. By the end of this exercise you will have the following monitoring capabilities enabled:

-   Diagnostic logging for the WVD service

-   Azure Monitor for the session host VMs

-   Log Analytics Monitoring Agent for the session host VMs

### Task 1: Create a Log Analytics workspace

A Log Analytics workspace is required for each of the monitoring capabilities covered in this exercise. You have the option to stream log data into different workspaces if desired. There are several factors to consider around a single workspace versus multiple. For example, RBAC controls, query performance, report development, etc\... For WVD
environments, it is common to have all monitor data pointing to a single dedicated workspace. If the environment in question is supporting both Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, consider creating a dedicated workspace for each.

In this exercise we will create a dedicated workspace for our Spring 2020 environment. If you already have a workspace created, move on to Task 2.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .

2.  At the top of the page, in the **Search resources** field, type \"**log analytics**\". Select **Log Analytics workspaces** from the list.

3.  On the Log Analytics workspaces blade, Select **+Add**.

4.  On the Create Log Analytics workspace blade, fill in the following information and Select **Review + Create**.

    -    **Subscription:** Select the desired subsciption for the Log Analytics workspace.

    -    **Resource Group:** Create a new resource group or select 1 from the list.

    -    **Name:** Enter a unique name for the workspace.

    -    **Region:** Select a region for the workspace.

5.  Select **Create**.

Monitor the notification bell in the upper-right corner and wait for the deployment to complete. Once complete, move on to task 2.

### Task 2: Enabling Diagnostic Logging for WVD

Like many other Azure services, WVD uses Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts. In order to enable diagnostic data collection, you need to enable it for each ARM object that you want to monitor (e.g. Host pools, Application groups, and Workspaces). Once enabled, it can take a few hours for the data to appear in your workspace.

Each WVD ARM object has different diagnostic data categories available. For example, host pool objects will have a different set of options then Workspaces. Refer to the following table for a summary of each data category and their associated objects.

  |              |            |     |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| **Category**  |**Description**  |                                                                 **ARM Object(s)** |
  Checkpoint   |       Specific steps in the lifetime of an activity that were reached. For example, during a session, a user was load balanced to a particular host, then the user was signed on during a connection, and so on. |  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces
  Connection    |      When users initiate and complete connections to the service.    |                                                                                                                                             Host pools
  Error       |        Are users encountering any issues with specific activities? This feature can generate a table that tracks activity data for you as long as the information is joined with the activities.     |               Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces |
  Feed   |             Can users successfully subscribe to workspaces? Do users see all resources published in the Remote Desktop client?      |                                                                                     Workspaces |
  Host Registration  | Was the session host successfully registered with the service upon connecting?       |                                                                                 Host pools| 
  Management     |     Track whether attempts to change Windows Virtual Desktop objects using APIs or PowerShell are successful. For example, can someone successfully create a host pool using PowerShell?       |                  Host pools, Application groups, Workspaces

[**Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature \| Example queries**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics#example-queries) 
```
## Troubleshooting

- Go to your Log Analytics workspace, and then select **Logs**. The example query UI is shown automatically.
- Change the filter to **Category**.
- Select **Windows Virtual Desktop** to review available queries.
- Select **Run** to run the selected query.

Often during the deployment of WVD there may be challenges with either having machines join the domain or installing the agent via automation.

### Domain troubleshooting

1.  Verify that the AD account has the correct permissions for domain joining machines based on the [blog domain join blog](https://www.prajwaldesai.com/allow-domain-user-to-add-computer-to-domain/).

When deploying WVD machines to the OU path below. This is the OU where the AD account AdAdmin has create and delete rights for machine objects. I've validated that he can manually create and delete AD objects in this OU.
```
MachineAccountOU: OU=AZWVD,DC=DS,DC=CUSTOMERDOMAIN,DC=COM

Verify using PowerShell that the AD account can create AD object in the OU

C:\\PS\>New-ADComputer -Name \"\'WVDPOC4-0\'\" -SamAccountName \"\'WVDPOC4-0\'\" -Path \"

OU=AZWVD,DC=DS,DC=CUSTOMERDOMAIN,DC=COM \"

Deployment failure for domain joining

{\"code\":\"DeploymentFailed\",\"message\":\"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see <https://aka.ms/arm-debug>  for usage details.\",\"details\":\[{\"code\":\"Conflict\",\"message\":\"{\\r\\n\\\"status\\\": \\\"Failed\\\",\\r\\n \\\"error\\\": {\\r\\n\\\"code\\\":\\\"ResourceDeploymentFailure\\\",\\r\\n \\\"message\\\":\\\"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state\'Failed\'.\\\",\\r\\n \\\"details\\\": \[\\r\\n {\\r\\n\\\"code\\\": **\\\"VMExtensionProvisioningError\\\",\\r\\n\\\"message\\\": \\\"VM has reported a failure when processing extension**

**Troubleshooting process**

In the session host we see these errors in event viewer.

After digging into the "NetSetup.log" file in the C:\\Windows\\Debug directory we see this.

**Resolution: Try the following steps to resolve domain join issues.**

When using an ARM template you man encounter domain join errors. Use the following tips to verify what information is being displayed.

1. Verify the AD permissions for the domain account. In some enterprises the account being used to join the domain is not a domain admin and only has limited rights to a specific Organizational Unit (OU) for create and delete of objects.

2. If you receive a domain join failure ensure that credentials are correct.

3. Attempt to provision a new windows machine with just the Azure portal and manually domain join the machine in the exact OU that the admin states he/she has permissions to.

    - Also if there may be enforced permissions to the OU you can try other OUs.

4. Attempt to use another elevated account from an IT person that has rights with other OUs.

5. If there is a failure for the domain join, RDP into the WVD machine that is created with the local account created that mirrors the domain account entered in the field. Open event viewer and in

    Generally error 5 means lack of permission. Which is what is implied from your comment that he has access only to a specific OU.

    Please review the following guide - [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2F4341920%2Ftroubleshoot-errors-that-occur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t&data=02%7C01%7CTony.Sanchez%40microsoft.com%7C9a12f152a1a04a424dd208d71585033d%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637001533351343241&sdata=ID58ohzrEMhdaOri5KgcnC9Ixk3mDW36qeAW6vEPpSc%3D&reserved=0)

6. Grab additional logs from the path

Windows clients log the details of domain join operations in the %windir%\\debug\\Netsetup.log file.

C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\scriptlogs.log

**C:WindowsdebugNetSetup.log**

7. also can you try this and provide the output?

To troubleshoot the issue, run a similar command from the command prompt to confirm the above analysis.

net use \[\\\\dcname\\ipc\$\](file://dcname/ipc\$) /u:\< domain\\user \> \< password \>

try the command above with a output that should say something like below:

8.  Verify that the password used for the account does not have a non-standard character that could cause issues.

Characters like "/" and others can cause automation to fail.

**WVD Agent troubleshooting**

**Troubleshooting WVD Agent issues**

Agent Installation and Update process:

-   Initial Version of the Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is downloaded and installed from an externally accessible download location (either [manually](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell#register-the-virtual-machines-to-the-windows-virtual-desktop-preview-host-pool) or via Azure Marketplace)

-   Once the Initial version of Windows Virtual Desktop Agent is installed, it queries the WVD service to determine the desired version of the WVD agent, Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent and SXS stack

-   Desired version of the Agent, Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Geneva Agent and SXS stack (in the same order) are then pulled from an Azure blob location and installed on the Virtual Machine.

-   This upgrade operation normally lasts about few minutes

-   There may be few scenarios where upgrade of the WVD agent may fail. When this scenario occurs output of the Get-RDSSessionnHost -TenantName \<tenantname\> -HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\> will be like below:

When this issue occurs, follow below steps to troubleshoot:

1.  Review WVD Agent installation C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft RDInfra\\AgentInstall.txt to see if the installation failed

2.  Review version of WVD Agent already installed on your VM.

 ? Go to Control Panel\\Programs\\Programs and Features. Look for latest version of "Remote Desktop Services Infrastructure Agent" installed on the Virtual Machine and note the same.

1.  Review if there is a later version of this agent downloaded onto the Virtual machine. Go to C:\\program files\\Microsoft RdInfra and look for versions later than one installed.

- The Agentinstall.txt log files has data regarding the agent installation. It may be helpful to open that log and verify that there are no errors that may related permissions used to install the agent.

-   In case there is a newer version:

    -   Attempt to manually install the MSI. Note this requires you to acquire and supply a new registration token. o Run the below cmdlet to create a registration token to authorize a session host to join the host pool and save it to a new file on your local computer. You can specify how long the registration token is valid by using the -ExpirationHours parameter.

    -   New-RdsRegistrationInfo -TenantName \<tenantname\> -HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\> -

ExpirationHours \<number of hours\> \| Select-Object -ExpandProperty Token \> \<PathToRegFile\>

-   In case there is no newer version:

o Uninstall all the versions of the agents from Control Panel\\Programs\\Programs and Features o Remove the session host from the host pool also before reinstalling the agent. Leaving the session host in the host pool can result in errors like the event ID 2277

NAME\_ALREADY\_REGISTERED image below. Remove-RdsSessionHost \[-TenantName\] \<String\> \[HostPoolName\] \<String\> \[-Name\] \<string\> \[-Force\]

Manually install Windows Virtual Desktop agent and register it using the steps described [here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-powershell) 

1.  Once the agent is manually installed, you should see the Get-RDSSessionHost -TenantName \<tenantname\> HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\> output as below:

```

1.  In case the manual installation fails, review

-   Contents of "UpdateErrorMessage" in Get-RDSSessionHost -TenantName
    \<tenantname\> -

HostPoolName \<hostpoolname\>

-   Application Event logs in Event Viewer:

o Event Viewer - \> Windows Logs -\> Application. Look for events with the source

-   MsiInstaller  ? RDAgentBootLoader

-   WVD-Agent-Updater

**Cases**

**WVD Connection: No resources available**

**Problem**

When connecting to a Host Pool you may come across an error such as:

**Possible reasons**

This problem can occur for multiple reasons:

-   if the VM running the host pool is shut off

-   If the VM running the host pool is deleted

-   The Host pool configuration is deprecated

**Solution**

Please first check if the VM is actually available and running in the Azure Portal. If that is the case, run:

```
Add-RdsAccount -DeploymentUrl \"https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com\"

\$tenant = Get-RdsTenant; \$tenant

\$tenantName = \$tenant.TenantName

\$hostpoolname = \"wvd-hostpool1\"

\$hostPoolLevelInput = @{

TenantName = \$tenantName

HostPoolName = \$hostpoolname

}
\$sessionHost = Get-RdsSessionHost \@hostPoolLevelInput; \$sessionHost
```
to check if the VM has any Heartbeat. The result may look like

```
SessionHostName : wvd-prefix-0.cookiedough.onmicrosoft.com

TenantName : WVDASETenant

TenantGroupName : Default Tenant Group

07/29/2019 20:51:47:212 Resolution: Try the following steps to resolve domain join issues.

When using an ARM template you man encounter domain join errors. Use the following tips to verify what information is being displayed.

1.  Verify the AD permissions for the domain account. In some enterprises the account being used to join the domain is not a domain admin and only has limited rights to a specific OU for create and delete of objects.

2. If you receive a domain join failure ensure that credentials are correct.

3.  Attempt to provision a new windows machine with just the Azure portal and manually domain join the machine in the exact OU that the admin states he/she has permissions to.

- Also if there may be enforced permissions to the OU you can try other OUs.

4. Attempt to use another elevated account from an IT person that has rights with other OUs.

5. If there is a failure for the domain join, RDP into the WVD machine that is created with the local account created that mirrors the domain account entered in the field. Open event viewer and in

Generally error 5 means lack of permission. Which is what is implied from your comment that he has access only to a specific OU.

>**Note**:Please review the following guide - [[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t]](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4341920/troubleshoot-errors-thatoccur-when-you-join-windows-based-computers-t) 

6. Grab additional logs from the path, Windows clients log the details of domain join operations in the %windir%\\debug\\Netsetup.log file.

C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\scriptlogs.log

C:WindowsdebugNetSetup.log

7. You also can you try this and provide the output?

    To troubleshoot the issue, run a similar command from the command prompt to confirm the above analysis.

    net use \[\\dcname\\ipc\](file://dcname/ipc\](*file*://*dcname*/*ipc*) /u:\< domain\\user \> \< password \>

    try the command above with a output that should say something like below.

8.  Verify that the password used for the account does not have a non-standard character that could cause issues.

    Characters like "/" and others can cause automation to fail.
